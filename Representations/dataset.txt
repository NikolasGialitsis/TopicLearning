[-LSB-edit-RSB- History The common guinea pig was first domesticated as early as 5000 BC for food by tribes in the Andean region of South America -LRB-present-day Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia-RRB-, some thousands of years after the domestication of the South American camelids.][[1.0]]
[Statues dating from ca. 500 BC to 500 AD that depict guinea pigs have been unearthed in archaeological digs in Peru and Ecuador.][[0.0]]
[The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped animals and often depicted the guinea pig in their art.][[0.0]]
[From ca. 1200 AD to the Spanish conquest in 1532, selective breeding resulted in many varieties of domestic guinea pigs, which form the basis for some of the modern domestic breeds.][[0.0]]
[They continue to be a food source in the region; most households in the Andean highlands raise the animal, which subsists off the family's vegetable scraps.][[0.0]]
[Folklore traditions involving guinea pigs are numerous; they are exchanged as gifts, used in customary social and religious ceremonies, and frequently referenced in spoken metaphors.][[0.0]]
[They also play a role in traditional healing rituals by folk doctors, or curanderos, who use the animals to diagnose diseases such as jaundice, rheumatism, arthritis, and typhus.][[0.0]]
[They are rubbed against the bodies of the sick, and are seen as a supernatural medium.][[0.0]]
[Black guinea pigs are considered especially useful for diagnoses.][[0.0]]
[The animal also may be cut open and its entrails examined to determine whether the cure was effective.][[0.0]]
[These methods are widely accepted in many parts of the Andes, where Western medicine is either unavailable or distrusted.][[0.0]]
[Spanish, Dutch, and English traders brought guinea pigs to Europe, where they quickly became popular as exotic pets among the upper classes and royalty, including Queen Elizabeth I.][[0.0]]
[The earliest known written account of the guinea pig dates from 1547, in a description of the animal from Santo Domingo; because cavies are not native to Hispaniola, the animal was likely introduced there by Spanish travelers.][[0.0]]
[The guinea pig was first described in the West in 1554 by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner.][[0.0]]
[Its binomial scientific name was first used by Erxleben in 1777; it is an amalgam of Pallas' generic designation -LRB-1766-RRB- and Linnaeus' specific conferral -LRB-1758-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Name The scientific name of the common species is Cavia porcellus, with porcellus being Latin for ``little pig''.][[0.0]]
[Cavia is New Latin; it is derived from cabiai, the animal's name in the language of the Galibi tribes once native to French Guiana.][[0.0]]
[Cabiai may be an adaptation of the Portuguese çavia -LRB-now savia-RRB-, which is itself derived from the Tupi word saujá, meaning rat.][[0.0]]
[Guinea pigs are called quwi or jaca in Quechua and cuy or cuyo -LRB-pl.][[0.0]]
[cuyes, cuyos-RRB- in the Spanish of Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia.][[0.0]]
[Ironically, breeders tend to use the more formal ``cavy'' to describe the animal, while in scientific and laboratory contexts it is far more commonly referred to by the more colloquial ``guinea pig''.][[0.0]]
[How the animals came to be thought of as ``pigs'' is not clear.][[0.0]]
[They are built somewhat like pigs, with large heads relative to their bodies, stout necks, and rounded rumps with no tail of any consequence; some of the sounds they emit are very similar to those made by pigs, and they also spend a large amount of time eating.][[0.0]]
[They can survive for long periods in small quarters, like a `pig pen', and were thus easily transported on ships to Europe.][[0.0]]
[The animal's name carries porcine connotations in many European languages.][[0.0]]
[The German word for them is Meerschweinchen, literally ``little sea pig'', which has been translated into Polish as świnka morska, into Hungarian as tengerimalac and into Russian as морская свинка which can be translated to English as ``sea pig''.][[0.0]]
[This derives from nautical history: sailing ships stopping to reprovision in the New World would pick up stores of guinea pigs, which provided an easily transportable source of fresh meat.][[0.0]]
[The French term is Cochon d'Inde -LRB-Indian pig-RRB- or cobaye; the Dutch used to call it guinees biggetje -LRB-Guinean piglet-RRB- or Spaanse rat -LRB-Spanish rat-RRB- in some dialects, and in Portuguese the guinea pig is variously referred to as cobaia, from the Tupi word via its Latinization, or as porquinho da Índia -LRB-little Indian pig-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[This is not universal; for example, the common word in Spanish is conejillo de Indias -LRB-little rabbit of India / the Indies-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Equally peculiar, the Chinese refer to them as Holland pigs -LRB-荷蘭豬, hélánzhū-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[The origin of ``guinea'' in ``guinea pig'' is harder to explain.][[0.0]]
[One theory is that the animals were brought to Europe by way of Guinea, leading people to think they had originated there.][[0.0]]
[``Guinea'' was also frequently used in English to refer generally to any far-off, unknown country, and so the name may simply be a colorful reference to the animal's foreignness.][[0.0]]
[Another theory suggests the ``guinea'' in the name is a corruption of ``Guiana'', an area in South America, though the animals are not native to that region.][[0.0]]
[A common misconception is that they were so named because they were sold for the price of a guinea coin; this theory is untenable, because the guinea was first struck in England in 1663, and William Harvey used the term ``Ginny-pig'' as early as 1653.][[0.0]]
[Others believe ``guinea'' may be an alteration of the word coney -LRB-rabbit-RRB-; guinea pigs were referred to as ``pig coneys'' in Edward Topsell's 1607 treatise on quadrupeds.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Traits and environment Guinea pigs are large for rodents, weighing between 700 and 1200g -LRB-1.5-2.5�pounds-RRB-, and measuring between 20 and 25�cm -LRB-8--10�inches-RRB- in length.][[0.0]]
[They typically live an average of four to five years, but may live as long as eight years.][[0.0]]
[According to the 2006 Guinness Book of Records the longest living guinea pig survived 14�years, 10.5�months.][[0.0]]
[In the 1990s, a minority scientific opinion emerged proposing that caviomorphs, such as guinea pigs, chinchillas, and degus, are not rodents and should be reclassified as a separate order of mammals -LRB-similar to lagomorphs-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Subsequent research using wider sampling has restored consensus among mammalian biologists that the current classification of rodents as monophyletic is justified.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Natural habitat Cavia porcellus is not found naturally in the wild; it is likely descendant from some closely related species of cavies, such as Cavia aperea, Cavia fulgida, and Cavia tschudii, which are still commonly found in various regions of South America.][[1.0]]
[Some species of cavy identified in the 20th century, such as Cavia anolaimae and Cavia guianae, may be domestic guinea pigs that have become feral by reintroduction into the wild.][[0.0]]
[Wild cavies are found on grassy plains and occupy an ecological niche similar to that of the cow.][[0.0]]
[They are social, living in the wild in small groups which consist of several females -LRB-sows-RRB-, a male -LRB-boar-RRB-, and the young -LRB-which in a break with the preceding porcine nomenclature are called pups-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[They move together in groups -LRB-herds-RRB- eating grass or other vegetation, and do not store food.][[0.0]]
[While they do not burrow or build nests, they frequently seek shelter in the burrows of other animals, as well as in crevices and tunnels formed by vegetation.][[0.0]]
[They are crepuscular, tending to be most active during dawn and dusk, when it is harder for predators to spot them.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Domestic habitat Domesticated guinea pigs thrive in groups of two or more; groups of sows, or groups of one or more sows and a neutered boar are common combinations.][[0.0]]
[Guinea pigs learn to recognize and bond with other individual guinea pigs, and testing of boars shows that their neuroendocrine stress response is significantly lowered in the presence of a bonded female when compared to the presence of unfamiliar females.][[0.0]]
[Groups of boars may also get along, provided that their cage has enough space, they are introduced at an early age, and no females are present.][[0.0]]
[Domestic guinea pigs have developed a different biological rhythm from their wild counterparts, and have longer periods of activity followed by short periods of sleep in between.][[0.0]]
[Activity is scattered randomly over the 24 hours of the day; aside from avoidance of intense light, no regular circadian patterns are apparent.][[0.0]]
[Domestic guinea pigs generally live in cages, although some owners of large numbers of guinea pigs will dedicate entire rooms to their pets.][[0.0]]
[Cages with solid or wire mesh floors are used, although wire mesh floors can cause injury and may be associated with an infection commonly known as bumblefoot -LRB-ulcerative pododermatitis-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[``Cubes and Coroplast'' -LRB-or C&C-RRB- style cages are now a common choice.][[0.0]]
[Cages are often lined with wood shavings or a similar material.][[0.0]]
[Bedding made from Red Cedar and pine, both softwoods, was commonly used in the past, however these materials are now believed to contain harmful phenols -LRB-aromatic hydrocarbons-RRB- and oils.][[0.0]]
[Safer beddings include those made from hardwoods -LRB-such as aspen-RRB-, paper products, and corn cob materials are other alternatives.][[0.0]]
[Guinea pigs tend to be messy within their cages; they often jump into their food bowls or kick bedding and feces into them, and their urine sometimes crystallizes on cage surfaces, making it difficult to remove.][[0.0]]
[After its cage has been cleaned, a guinea pig will typically urinate and drag the lower body across the floor of the cage to mark its territory.][[0.0]]
[Male guinea pigs may also mark their territory in this way when they are taken out of their cages.][[0.0]]
[Guinea pigs do not generally thrive when housed with other species.][[0.0]]
[Cohousing of guinea pigs with other rodents such as gerbils and hamsters may increase instances of respiratory and other infections, and such rodents may act aggressively toward the guinea pig.][[0.0]]
[Larger animals may regard guinea pigs as prey, though some -LRB-such as dogs-RRB- can be trained to accept them.][[0.0]]
[Opinion is divided over the cohousing of guinea pigs and domestic rabbits.][[0.0]]
[Some published sources say that guinea pigs and rabbits complement each other well when sharing a cage.][[0.0]]
[However, as lagomorphs, rabbits have different nutritional requirements, and so the two species cannot be fed the same food.][[0.0]]
[Rabbits may also harbor diseases -LRB-such as the respiratory infections Bordetella and Pasteurella-RRB-, to which guinea pigs are susceptible.][[0.0]]
[Even the dwarf rabbit is much stronger than the guinea pig and may cause intentional or inadvertent injury.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Behavior Guinea pigs can learn complex paths to food, and can accurately remember a learned path for months.][[0.0]]
[Their strongest problem solving strategy is motion.][[0.0]]
[While guinea pigs can jump small obstacles, they are poor climbers, and are not particularly agile.][[0.0]]
[They startle extremely easily, and will either freeze in place for long periods or run for cover with rapid, darting motions when they sense danger.][[0.0]]
[Larger groups of startled guinea pigs will ``stampede'', running in haphazard directions as a means of confusing predators.][[0.0]]
[When excited, guinea pigs may repeatedly perform little hops in the air -LRB-known as ``popcorning''-RRB-, a movement analogous to the ferret's war dance.][[0.0]]
[They are also exceedingly good swimmers.][[0.0]]
[Like many rodents, guinea pigs sometimes participate in social grooming, and they regularly self-groom.][[0.0]]
[A milky-white substance is secreted from their eyes and rubbed into the hair during the grooming process.][[0.0]]
[Groups of boars will often chew each other's hair, but this is a method of establishing hierarchy within a group, rather than a social gesture.][[0.0]]
[Dominance is also established through biting -LRB-especially of the ears-RRB-, piloerection, aggressive noises, head thrusts, and leaping attacks.][[0.0]]
[Non-sexual simulated mounting for dominance is also common among same-sex groups.][[0.0]]
[Guinea pig sight is not as good as a human, but they have a wider range of vision -LRB-about 340°-RRB- and see in partial color -LRB-dichromacy-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[They have well-developed senses of hearing, smell, and touch.][[0.0]]
[Vocalization is the primary means of communication between members of the species.][[0.0]]
[Some sounds are:  -LSB-edit-RSB- Breeding The guinea pig is able to breed year-round, with birth peaks usually coming in the spring; as many as five litters can be produced per year.][[0.0]]
[The gestation period lasts from 59--72 days, with an average of 63--68 days.][[0.0]]
[Because of the long gestation period and the large size of the pups, pregnant females may become large and eggplant-shaped, although the change in size and shape varies.][[0.0]]
[Newborn pups are well-developed with hair, teeth, claws, and partial eyesight; they are immediately mobile, and begin eating solid food immediately, though they continue to suckle.][[0.0]]
[Litters yield 1--6 pups, with an average of three; the largest recorded litter size is 17.][[0.0]]
[In smaller litters, difficulties may occur during labour due to over-sized pups.][[0.0]]
[Large litters result in higher incidences of stillbirth, but because the pups are delivered at an advanced stage of development, lack of access to the mother's milk has little effect on the mortality rate of newborns.][[0.0]]
[Cohabitating females assist in mothering duties if lactating.][[0.0]]
[Male and female guinea pigs do not differ in external appearance apart from general size.][[0.0]]
[The position of the anus is very close to the genitals in both sexes.][[0.0]]
[Female genitals are distinguished by a Y-shaped configuration formed from a vulvar flap; while the male genitals may look similar with the penis and anus forming a like shape, the penis will protrude if pressure is applied to the surrounding hair.][[0.0]]
[The male's testes may also be visible externally from scrotal swelling.][[0.0]]
[Males reach sexual maturity at 3--5 weeks; females can be fertile as early as four weeks and can carry litters before they are adults.][[0.0]]
[Females that have never given birth commonly develop irreversible fusing of the pubic symphysis, a joint in the pelvis, after six months of age.][[0.0]]
[If they become pregnant after this has happened, the birth canal will not widen sufficiently; this may lead to dystocia and death as they attempt to give birth.][[0.0]]
[Females can become pregnant 6--48 hours after giving birth, but it is not healthy for a female to be thus constantly pregnant.][[0.0]]
[Toxemia of pregnancy is common and kills many pregnant females.][[0.0]]
[Signs of toxemia include anorexia, lack of energy, excessive salivation, a sweet or fruity breath odor due to ketones, and seizures in advanced cases.][[0.0]]
[Pregnancy toxemia appears to be most common in hot climates.][[0.0]]
[Other serious complications of pregnancy can include a prolapsed uterus, hypocalcaemia, and mastitis.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Diet Grass is the guinea pig's natural diet.][[0.0]]
[Their molars are particularly suited for grinding plant matter, and grow continuously throughout the animal's life.][[0.0]]
[Most grass-eating mammals are quite large and have a long digestive tract; while guinea pigs have much longer colons than most rodents, they must also supplement their diet by coprophagy, the eating of their own feces.][[0.0]]
[However, they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately, but produce special soft pellets, called cecotropes, which recycle B vitamins, fiber, and bacteria required for proper digestion.][[0.0]]
[The cecotropes -LRB-or caecal pellets-RRB- are eaten directly from the anus, unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese.][[1.0]]
[They share this behaviour with rabbits.][[0.0]]
[In geriatric boars or sows -LRB-the condition is rarer in young ones-RRB-, the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus for consumption can become weak.][[0.0]]
[This creates a condition known as anal impaction, which prevents the boar from redigesting cecotropes, though harder pellets may pass through the impacted mass.][[0.0]]
[The condition may be temporarily alleviated by carefully expelling the impacted feces.][[0.0]]
[Guinea pigs benefit from feeding on fresh grass hay, such as timothy hay, in addition to food pellets which are often based from timothy.][[0.0]]
[Alfalfa is also a popular food choice; most guinea pigs will eat large amounts of alfalfa when offered it, though there exists some controversy over the feeding of alfalfa to adult guinea pigs.][[0.0]]
[Some pet owners and veterinary organizations have advised that, as a legume rather than a grass hay, alfalfa consumed in large amounts may lead to obesity, as well as bladder stones due to excess calcium, in any but pregnant and very young guinea pigs.][[0.0]]
[However, published scientific sources mention alfalfa as a source for replenishment of protein, amino acids, and fiber.][[0.0]]
[Like humans, but unlike most other mammals, guinea pigs cannot synthesize their own vitamin C and must obtain this vital nutrient from food.][[0.0]]
[If guinea pigs do not ingest enough vitamin C, they can suffer from potentially fatal scurvy.][[0.0]]
[Guinea pigs require about 10�mg -LRB-0.15�gr-RRB- of vitamin C daily -LRB-20�mg -LRB-0.31�gr-RRB- if pregnant-RRB-, which can be obtained through fresh, raw fruits and vegetables -LRB-such as broccoli, apple, cabbage, carrot, celery, and spinach-RRB- or through dietary supplements.][[0.0]]
[Healthy diets for guinea pigs require a complex balance of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and hydrogen ions; adequate amounts of vitamins E, A, and D are also necessary.][[0.0]]
[Imbalanced diets have been associated with muscular dystrophy, metastatic calcification, difficulties with pregnancy, vitamin deficiencies, and teeth problems.][[0.0]]
[Guinea pigs tend to be fickle eaters when it comes to fresh fruits and vegetables, having learned early in life what is and is not appropriate to consume, and their habits are difficult to change after maturity.][[0.0]]
[They do not respond well to sudden changes in diet; they may stop eating and starve rather than accepting new food types.][[0.0]]
[A constant supply of hay or other food is generally recommended, as guinea pigs feed continuously and may develop habits such as chewing on their own hair if food is not present.][[0.0]]
[Because guinea pigs' teeth grow constantly, they routinely gnaw, lest their teeth become too large for their mouth, a common problem in rodents.][[0.0]]
[Guinea pigs will also chew on cloth, paper, plastic, and rubber.][[0.0]]
[A number of plants are poisonous to guinea pigs, including bracken, bryony, buttercup, charlock, deadly nightshade, foxglove, hellebore, hemlock, Lily of the Valley, mayweed, monkshood, privet, ragwort, rhubarb, speedwell, toadflax, and wild celery.][[0.0]]
[Additionally, any plant which grows from a bulb -LRB-e.g., tulip and onion-RRB- is normally considered poisonous.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Health Common ailments in domestic guinea pigs include respiratory tract infections, diarrhea, scurvy -LRB-vitamin C deficiency, typically characterized by sluggishness-RRB-, abscesses due to infection -LRB-often in the neck, due to hay embedded in the throat, or from external scratches-RRB-, and infections by lice, mites, or fungus.][[0.0]]
[Mange mites -LRB-Trixacarus caviae-RRB- are a common cause of hair loss, and other symptoms may also include excessive scratching, unusually aggressive behavior when touched -LRB-due to pain-RRB-, and, in some instances, seizures.][[0.0]]
[Guinea pigs may also suffer from ``running lice'' -LRB-Gliricola porcelli-RRB-, a small white insect which can be seen moving through the hair; the eggs of these lice, which appear as black or white specks attached to the hair, are sometimes referred to as ``static lice''.][[0.0]]
[Giving a bath with neem oil soap is a gentle and effective way of ridding the pig of lice.][[0.0]]
[Other causes of hair loss can be due to hormonal upsets caused by underlying medical conditions such as ovarian cysts.][[0.0]]
[Neem oil is an effective treatment for the parasitic skin problems in pet Guinea Pigs, at a dilution rate of four parts of carrier oil to one part of Neem oil.][[0.0]]
[Foreign bodies, especially small pieces of hay or straw, can become lodged in the eyes of guinea pigs, resulting in excessive blinking, tearing, and in some cases an opaque film over the eye due to corneal ulcer.][[0.0]]
[Hay or straw dust can also cause sneezing.][[0.0]]
[While it is normal for guinea pigs to sneeze periodically, frequent sneezing may be a symptom of pneumonia, especially in response to atmospheric changes.][[0.0]]
[Pneumonia may also be accompanied by torticollis and can be fatal.][[0.0]]
[Because the guinea pig has a stout, compact body, the animal more easily tolerates excessive cold than excessive heat.][[0.0]]
[Its normal body temperature is 101--104�°F -LRB-38--40�°C-RRB-, and so its ideal ambient air temperature range is similar to the human's, about 65--75�°F -LRB-18--24�°C-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Consistent ambient temperatures in excess of 90�°F -LRB-32�°C-RRB- have been linked to hyperthermia and death, especially among pregnant sows.][[0.0]]
[Guinea pigs are not well suited to environments that feature wind or frequent drafts, and respond poorly to extremes of humidity outside of the range of 30--70%.][[0.0]]
[Guinea pigs are prey animals whose survival instinct is to mask pain and signs of illness, and many times health problems may not be apparent until a condition is severe or in its advanced stages.][[0.0]]
[Treatment of disease is made more difficult by the extreme sensitivity guinea pigs have to most antibiotics, including penicillin, which kill off the intestinal flora and quickly bring on episodes of diarrhea and in some cases, death.][[0.0]]
[Similar to the inherited genetic diseases of other breeds of animal -LRB-such as hip dysplasia in canines-RRB-, a number of genetic abnormalities of guinea pigs have been reported.][[0.0]]
[Most commonly, the roan coloration of Abyssinian guinea pigs is associated with congenital eye disorders and problems with the digestive system.][[0.0]]
[Other genetic disorders include ``waltzing disease'' -LRB-deafness coupled with a tendency to run in circles-RRB-, palsy, and tremor conditions.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Pets If handled correctly early in their life, guinea pigs become amenable to being picked up and carried, and seldom bite or scratch.][[0.0]]
[They are timid explorers, and rarely attempt to escape from their cages, even when an opportunity presents itself.][[0.0]]
[Guinea pigs who become familiar with their owner will whistle on the owner's approach; they will also learn to whistle in response to the rustling of plastic bags or the opening of refrigerator doors, where their food is most commonly stored.][[0.0]]
[Domesticated guinea pigs come in many breeds, which have been developed since their introduction to Europe and North America.][[0.0]]
[These varieties vary in hair and color composition.][[0.0]]
[The most common varieties found in pet stores are the English shorthair -LRB-also known as the American-RRB-, which have a short, smooth coat, and the Abyssinian, whose coat is ruffled with cowlicks, or rosettes.][[0.0]]
[Also popular among breeders are the Peruvian and the Sheltie -LRB-or Silkie-RRB-, both straight longhair breeds, and the Texel, a curly longhair.][[0.0]]
[Cavy Clubs and Associations dedicated to the showing and breeding of guinea pigs have been established worldwide.][[1.0]]
[The American Cavy Breeders Association, an adjunct to the American Rabbit Breeders' Association, is the governing body in the United States and Canada.][[0.0]]
[The British Cavy Council governs cavy clubs in the United Kingdom.][[0.0]]
[Similar organizations exist in Australia -LRB-Australian National Cavy Council-RRB- and New Zealand -LRB-New Zealand Cavy Club-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Each club publishes its own Standard of Perfection and determines which breeds are eligible for showing.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Cultural and media influence As a result of their widespread popularity in human domestic life, and especially because of their popularity in households with children, guinea pigs have shown a presence in culture and media.][[0.0]]
[Some noted appearances of the animal in literature are The Fairy Caravan, a novel by Beatrix Potter, and Michael Bond's Olga da Polga series for children, both of which feature guinea pigs as the central protagonist.][[0.0]]
[Another appearance is in The Magician's Nephew by C. S. Lewis: in the first -LRB-chronologically-RRB- of his The Chronicles of Narnia series, a guinea pig is the first creature to travel to the Wood between the Worlds.][[0.0]]
[The short story Pigs Is Pigs by Ellis Parker Butler is a tale of bureaucratic incompetence; two guinea pigs held at a train station breed unchecked while humans argue as to whether they are ``pigs'' for the purpose of determining freight charges.][[0.0]]
[In the Golden Hamster Saga books, there are two guinea pigs named Enrico and Caruso who are modern-day thespians -LRB-named after Enrico Caruso-RRB- who serve as secondary characters, and often irritate the main character, Freddy Auratus who strongly dislikes their acting antics.][[0.0]]
[Guinea pigs have also been featured in film and television.][[0.0]]
[In the TV movie Shredderman Rules, the main character and the main character's crush both have guinea pigs which both play a minor part in the plot.][[0.0]]
[A guinea pig named Rodney, voiced by Chris Rock, was a prominent character in the 1998 film Dr. Dolittle and Linny the Guinea pig is a co-star on Nick Jr.'s Wonder Pets.][[0.0]]
[Guinea pigs were used in some major advertising campaigns in the 1990s and 2000s, notably for Egg Banking plc, Snapple, and Blockbuster Video.][[0.0]]
[The Blockbuster campaign is considered by some guinea pig advocates to have been a factor in the rise of cohousing guinea pigs and rabbits.][[0.0]]
[In the South Park season 12 episode ``Pandemic 2: The Startling'',giant guinea pigs dressed in costumes, are portrayed as rampaging over the entire Earth.][[0.0]]
[The Walt Disney Pictures movie G-Force, released in the United States on July 24, 2009, features a group of highly intelligent guinea pigs trained as operatives of the U.S. government.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Scientific research The use of guinea pigs in scientific experimentation dates back at least to the 17th century, when the Italian biologists Marcello Malpighi and Carlo Fracassati conducted vivisections of guinea pigs in their examinations of anatomic structures.][[1.0]]
[In 1780, Antoine Lavoisier used a guinea pig in his experiments with the calorimeter, a device used to measure heat production.][[0.0]]
[The heat from the guinea pig's respiration melted snow surrounding the calorimeter, showing that respiratory gas exchange is a combustion, similar to a candle burning.][[0.0]]
[Guinea pigs played a major role in the establishment of germ theory in the late 19th century, through the experiments of Louis Pasteur, Émile Roux, and Robert Koch.][[0.0]]
[Guinea pigs have been launched into orbital space-flight several times, first by the USSR on the Sputnik 9 biosatellite of March 9, 1961 - with a successful recovery.][[0.0]]
[China also launched and recovered a biosatellite in 1990 which included guinea pigs as passengers.][[0.0]]
[In English, the term guinea pig is commonly used as a metaphor for a subject of scientific experimentation, or any experiment or test in modern times.][[0.0]]
[This dates back to the early 20th century; the Oxford English Dictionary notes its first usage in this capacity in 1913.][[0.0]]
[In 1933, Consumers Research founders F. J. Schlink and Arthur Kallet wrote a book entitled 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs, extending the metaphor to consumer society.][[0.0]]
[The book became a national bestseller in the United States, thus further popularizing the term, and spurred the growth of the consumer protection movement.][[0.0]]
[The negative connotation of the term was later employed in the novel The Guinea Pigs by Czech author Ludvík Vaculík as an allegory for Soviet totalitarianism.][[0.0]]
[Guinea pigs were popular laboratory animals until the later 20th century; about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the U.S. for research in the 1960s, but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s.][[0.0]]
[As of 2007, they constitute approximately 2% of the current total of laboratory animals.][[0.0]]
[In the past they were widely used to standardize vaccines and antiviral agents; they were also often employed in studies on the production of antibodies in response to extreme allergic reactions, or anaphylaxis.][[0.0]]
[Less common uses included research in pharmacology and irradiation.][[0.0]]
[Since the middle 20th century, they have been replaced in laboratory contexts primarily by mice and rats.][[1.0]]
[This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents, although geneticists W. E. Castle and Sewall Wright made a number of contributions to this area of study, especially regarding coat color.][[0.0]]
[In 2004, the U.S.'s National Human Genome Research Institute announced plans to sequence the genome of the domestic guinea pig.][[0.0]]
[The guinea pig was most extensively implemented in research and diagnosis of infectious diseases.][[0.0]]
[Common uses included identification of brucellosis, Chagas disease, cholera, diphtheria, foot-and-mouth disease, glanders, Q fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and various strains of typhus.][[0.0]]
[They are still frequently used to diagnose tuberculosis, since they are easily infected by human tuberculosis bacteria.][[1.0]]
[Because guinea pigs are one of the few animals which, like humans, cannot synthesize vitamin C but must obtain it from their diet, they are ideal for researching scurvy.][[0.0]]
[From the accidental discovery in 1907 that scurvy could be induced in guinea pigs, to their use to prove the chemical structure of the ``ascorbutic factor'' in 1932, the guinea pig model proved a crucial part of vitamin C research.][[0.0]]
[Complement, an important component for serology, was first isolated from the blood of the guinea pig.][[0.0]]
[Guinea pigs have an unusual insulin mutation, and are a suitable species for the generation of anti-insulin antibodies.][[0.0]]
[Present at a level 10 times that found in other mammals, the insulin in guinea pigs may be important in growth regulation, a role usually played by growth hormone.][[0.0]]
[Additionally, guinea pigs have been identified as model organisms for the study of juvenile diabetes and, because of the frequency of pregnancy toxemia, of pre-eclampsia in human females.][[0.0]]
[Guinea pig strains used in scientific research are primarily outbred strains.][[1.0]]
[Aside from the common American or English stock, the two main outbred strains in laboratory use are the Hartley and Dunkin-Hartley; these English strains are albino, although pigmented strains are also available.][[0.0]]
[Inbred strains are less common and are usually used for very specific research, such as immune system molecular biology.][[0.0]]
[Of the inbred strains that have been created, the two that are still used with any frequency are, following Sewall Wright's designations, ``Strain 2'' and ``Strain 13''.][[0.0]]
[Hairless breeds of guinea pigs have been used in scientific research since the 1980s, particularly for dermatological studies.][[0.0]]
[A hairless and immunodeficient breed was the result of a spontaneous genetic mutation in inbred laboratory strains from the Hartley stock at the Eastman Kodak Company in 1979.][[0.0]]
[An immunocompetent hairless breed was also identified by the Institute Armand Frappier in 1978, and Charles River Laboratories has reproduced this breed for research since 1982.][[0.0]]
[Cavy fanciers then began acquiring hairless breeds, and the pet hairless varieties are referred to as ``skinny pigs''.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- As food Guinea pigs -LRB-called cuy, cuye, curí-RRB- were originally domesticated for their meat in the Andes.][[0.0]]
[Traditionally, the animal was usually reserved for ceremonial meals by indigenous people in the Andean highlands, but since the 1960s it has become more socially acceptable for consumption by all people.][[0.0]]
[It continues to be a major part of the diet in Peru and Bolivia, particularly in the Andes Mountains highlands; it is also eaten in some areas of Ecuador -LRB-mainly in the Sierra-RRB- and Colombia.][[0.0]]
[Because guinea pigs require much less room than traditional livestock and reproduce extremely quickly, they are a more profitable source of food and income than many traditional stock animals, such as pigs and cows; moreover, they can be raised in an urban environment.][[0.0]]
[Both rural and urban families raise guinea pigs for supplementary income, and the animals are commonly bought and sold at local markets and large-scale municipal fairs.][[0.0]]
[Guinea pig meat is high in protein and low in fat and cholesterol, and is described as being similar to rabbit and the dark meat of chicken.][[0.0]]
[The animal may be served fried -LRB-chactado or frito-RRB-, broiled -LRB-asado-RRB-, or roasted -LRB-al horno-RRB-, and in urban restaurants may also be served in a casserole or a fricassee.][[0.0]]
[Ecuadorians commonly consume sopa or locro de cuy, a soup dish.][[0.0]]
[Pachamanca or huatia, a process similar to barbecueing, is also popular, and is usually served with corn beer -LRB-chicha-RRB- in traditional settings.][[0.0]]
[Peruvians consume an estimated 65 million guinea pigs each year, and the animal is so entrenched in the culture that one famous painting of the Last Supper in the main cathedral in Cusco shows Christ and the twelve disciples dining on guinea pig.][[0.0]]
[The animal remains an important aspect of certain religious events in both rural and urban areas of Peru.][[0.0]]
[A religious celebration known as jaca tsariy -LRB-``collecting the cuys''-RRB- is a major festival in many villages in the Antonio Raimondi province of eastern Peru, and is celebrated in smaller ceremonies in Lima.][[0.0]]
[It is a syncretistic event, combining elements of Catholicism and pre-Columbian religious practices, and revolves around the celebration of local patron saints.][[0.0]]
[The exact form that the jaca tsariy takes differs from town to town; in some localities, a sirvinti -LRB-servant-RRB- is appointed to go from door to door, collecting donations of guinea pigs, while in others, guinea pigs may be brought to a communal area to be released in a mock bullfight.][[0.0]]
[Meals such as cuy chactado are always served as part of these festivities, and the killing and serving of the animal is framed by some communities as a symbolic satire of local politicians or important figures.][[0.0]]
[In the Tungurahua and Cotopaxi provinces of central Ecuador, guinea pigs are employed in the celebrations surrounding the feast of Corpus Christi as part of the Ensayo, which is a community meal, and the Octava, where castillos -LRB-greased poles-RRB- are erected with prizes tied to the crossbars, from which several guinea pigs may be hung.][[0.0]]
[The Peruvian town of Churin has an annual festival which involves dressing guinea pigs in elaborate costumes for a competition.][[0.0]]
[Andean immigrants in New York City raise and sell guinea pigs for meat, and some ethnic restaurants in major United States cities serve cuy as a delicacy.][[0.0]]
[Peruvian research universities, especially La Molina National Agrarian University, began experimental programs in the 1960s with the intention of breeding larger-sized guinea pigs.][[0.0]]
[Subsequent university efforts have sought to change breeding and husbandry procedures in South America, in order to make the raising of guinea pigs as livestock more economically sustainable.][[0.0]]
[In the 1990s and 2000s, the university began exporting the larger breed guinea pigs to Europe, Japan, and the United States in the hope of increasing human consumption outside of these countries in northern South America.][[1.0]]
[Efforts have also been made to introduce guinea pig husbandry in developing countries in West Africa.][[1.0]]
[Nevertheless, as a food source they are still generally considered taboo in other countries in America and Europe; in reality television, guinea pig meat has been consumed as an exotic dish by such Western celebrity chefs as Andrew Zimmern -LRB-for his show Bizarre Foods-RRB- and Anthony Bourdain in No Reservations.][[1.0]]

[-LSB-edit-RSB- History The nucleus was the first organelle to be discovered.][[1.0]]
[The probably oldest preserved drawing dates back to the early microscopist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek -LRB-1632 -- 1723-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[He observed a ``Lumen'', the nucleus, in the red blood cells of salmon .][[0.0]]
[Unlike mammalian red blood cells, those of other vertebrates still possess nuclei.][[0.0]]
[The nucleus was also described by Franz Bauer in 1804 and in more detail in 1831 by Scottish botanist Robert Brown in a talk at the Linnean Society of London.][[0.0]]
[Brown was studying orchids microscopically when he observed an opaque area, which he called the areola or nucleus, in the cells of the flower's outer layer.][[0.0]]
[He did not suggest a potential function.][[0.0]]
[In 1838 Matthias Schleiden proposed that the nucleus plays a role in generating cells, thus he introduced the name ``Cytoblast'' -LRB-cell builder-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[He believed that he had observed new cells assembling around ``cytoblasts''.][[0.0]]
[Franz Meyen was a strong opponent of this view having already described cells multiplying by division and believing that many cells would have no nuclei.][[0.0]]
[The idea that cells can be generated de novo, by the ``cytoblast'' or otherwise, contradicted work by Robert Remak -LRB-1852-RRB- and Rudolf Virchow -LRB-1855-RRB- who decisively propagated the new paradigm that cells are generated solely by cells -LRB-``Omnis cellula e cellula''-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[The function of the nucleus remained unclear.][[0.0]]
[Between 1876 and 1878 Oscar Hertwig published several studies on the fertilization of sea urchin eggs, showing that the nucleus of the sperm enters the oocyte and fuses with its nucleus.][[0.0]]
[This was the first time it was suggested that an individual develops from a -LRB-single-RRB- nucleated cell.][[0.0]]
[This was in contradiction to Ernst Haeckel's theory that the complete phylogeny of a species would be repeated during embryonic development, including generation of the first nucleated cell from a ``Monerula'', a structureless mass of primordial mucus -LRB-``Urschleim''-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Therefore, the necessity of the sperm nucleus for fertilization was discussed for quite some time.][[0.0]]
[However, Hertwig confirmed his observation in other animal groups, e.g. amphibians and molluscs.][[0.0]]
[Eduard Strasburger produced the same results for plants -LRB-1884-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[This paved the way to assign the nucleus an important role in heredity.][[0.0]]
[In 1873 August Weismann postulated the equivalence of the maternal and paternal germ cells for heredity.][[0.0]]
[The function of the nucleus as carrier of genetic information became clear only later, after mitosis was discovered and the Mendelian rules were rediscovered at the beginning of the 20th century; the chromosome theory of heredity was developed.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Structures The nucleus is the largest cellular organelle in animals.][[0.0]]
[In mammalian cells, the average diameter of the nucleus is approximately 6 micrometers -LRB-μm-RRB-, which occupies about 10% of the total cell volume.][[1.0]]
[The viscous liquid within it is called nucleoplasm, and is similar in composition to the cytosol found outside the nucleus.][[0.0]]
[It appears as a dense, roughly spherical organelle.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Nuclear envelope and pores The nuclear envelope otherwise known as nuclear membrane consists of two cellular membranes, an inner and an outer membrane, arranged parallel to one another and separated by 10 to 50 nanometers -LRB-nm-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[The nuclear envelope completely encloses the nucleus and separates the cell's genetic material from the surrounding cytoplasm, serving as a barrier to prevent macromolecules from diffusing freely between the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm.][[1.0]]
[The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum -LRB-RER-RRB-, and is similarly studded with ribosomes.][[0.0]]
[The space between the membranes is called the perinuclear space and is continuous with the RER lumen.][[0.0]]
[Nuclear pores, which provide aqueous channels through the envelope, are composed of multiple proteins, collectively referred to as nucleoporins.][[0.0]]
[The pores are about 125 million daltons in molecular weight and consist of around 50 -LRB-in yeast-RRB- to 100 proteins -LRB-in vertebrates-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[The pores are 100 nm in total diameter; however, the gap through which molecules freely diffuse is only about 9 nm wide, due to the presence of regulatory systems within the center of the pore.][[0.0]]
[This size allows the free passage of small water-soluble molecules while preventing larger molecules, such as nucleic acids and larger proteins, from inappropriately entering or exiting the nucleus.][[1.0]]
[These large molecules must be actively transported into the nucleus instead.][[0.0]]
[The nucleus of a typical mammalian cell will have about 3000 to 4000 pores throughout its envelope, each of which contains a donut-shaped, eightfold-symmetric ring-shaped structure at a position where the inner and outer membranes fuse.][[0.0]]
[Attached to the ring is a structure called the nuclear basket that extends into the nucleoplasm, and a series of filamentous extensions that reach into the cytoplasm.][[0.0]]
[Both structures serve to mediate binding to nuclear transport proteins.][[0.0]]
[Most proteins, ribosomal subunits, and some RNAs are transported through the pore complexes in a process mediated by a family of transport factors known as karyopherins.][[0.0]]
[Those karyopherins that mediate movement into the nucleus are also called importins, while those that mediate movement out of the nucleus are called exportins.][[0.0]]
[Most karyopherins interact directly with their cargo, although some use adaptor proteins.][[0.0]]
[Steroid hormones such as cortisol and aldosterone, as well as other small lipid-soluble molecules involved in intercellular signaling can diffuse through the cell membrane and into the cytoplasm, where they bind nuclear receptor proteins that are trafficked into the nucleus.][[0.0]]
[There they serve as transcription factors when bound to their ligand; in the absence of ligand many such receptors function as histone deacetylases that repress gene expression.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Nuclear lamina In animal cells, two networks of intermediate filaments provide the nucleus with mechanical support: the nuclear lamina forms an organized meshwork on the internal face of the envelope, while less organized support is provided on the cytosolic face of the envelope.][[0.0]]
[Both systems provide structural support for the nuclear envelope and anchoring sites for chromosomes and nuclear pores.][[0.0]]
[The nuclear lamina is mostly composed of lamin proteins.][[0.0]]
[Like all proteins, lamins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and later transported into the nucleus interior, where they are assembled before being incorporated into the existing network of nuclear lamina.][[0.0]]
[Lamins are also found inside the nucleoplasm where they form another regular structure, known as the nucleoplasmic veil, that is visible using fluorescence microscopy.][[0.0]]
[The actual function of the veil is not clear, although it is excluded from the nucleolus and is present during interphase.][[0.0]]
[The lamin structures that make up the veil bind chromatin and disrupting their structure inhibits transcription of protein-coding genes.][[0.0]]
[Like the components of other intermediate filaments, the lamin monomer contains an alpha-helical domain used by two monomers to coil around each other, forming a dimer structure called a coiled coil.][[0.0]]
[Two of these dimer structures then join side by side, in an antiparallel arrangement, to form a tetramer called a protofilament.][[0.0]]
[Eight of these protofilaments form a lateral arrangement that is twisted to form a ropelike filament.][[0.0]]
[These filaments can be assembled or disassembled in a dynamic manner, meaning that changes in the length of the filament depend on the competing rates of filament addition and removal.][[0.0]]
[Mutations in lamin genes leading to defects in filament assembly are known as laminopathies.][[0.0]]
[The most notable laminopathy is the family of diseases known as progeria, which causes the appearance of premature aging in its sufferers.][[0.0]]
[The exact mechanism by which the associated biochemical changes give rise to the aged phenotype is not well understood.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Chromosomes The cell nucleus contains the majority of the cell's genetic material, in the form of multiple linear DNA molecules organized into structures called chromosomes.][[1.0]]
[During most of the cell cycle these are organized in a DNA-protein complex known as chromatin, and during cell division the chromatin can be seen to form the well defined chromosomes familiar from a karyotype.][[0.0]]
[A small fraction of the cell's genes are located instead in the mitochondria.][[0.0]]
[There are two types of chromatin.][[0.0]]
[Euchromatin is the less compact DNA form, and contains genes that are frequently expressed by the cell.][[0.0]]
[The other type, heterochromatin, is the more compact form, and contains DNA that are infrequently transcribed.][[0.0]]
[This structure is further categorized into facultative heterochromatin, consisting of genes that are organized as heterochromatin only in certain cell types or at certain stages of development, and constitutive heterochromatin that consists of chromosome structural components such as telomeres and centromeres.][[0.0]]
[During interphase the chromatin organizes itself into discrete individual patches, called chromosome territories.][[0.0]]
[Active genes, which are generally found in the euchromatic region of the chromosome, tend to be located towards the chromosome's territory boundary.][[0.0]]
[Antibodies to certain types of chromatin organization, particularly nucleosomes, have been associated with a number of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus.][[0.0]]
[These are known as anti-nuclear antibodies -LRB-ANA-RRB- and have also been observed in concert with multiple sclerosis as part of general immune system dysfunction.][[0.0]]
[As in the case of progeria, the role played by the antibodies in inducing the symptoms of autoimmune diseases is not obvious.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Nucleolus The nucleolus is a discrete densely stained structure found in the nucleus.][[0.0]]
[It is not surrounded by a membrane, and is sometimes called a suborganelle.][[0.0]]
[It forms around tandem repeats of rDNA, DNA coding for ribosomal RNA -LRB-rRNA-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[These regions are called nucleolar organizer regions -LRB-NOR-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[The main roles of the nucleolus are to synthesize rRNA and assemble ribosomes.][[0.0]]
[The structural cohesion of the nucleolus depends on its activity, as ribosomal assembly in the nucleolus results in the transient association of nucleolar components, facilitating further ribosomal assembly, and hence further association.][[0.0]]
[This model is supported by observations that inactivation of rDNA results in intermingling of nucleolar structures.][[0.0]]
[The first step in ribosomal assembly is transcription of the rDNA, by a protein called RNA polymerase I, forming a large pre-rRNA precursor.][[0.0]]
[This is cleaved into the subunits 5.8S, 18S, and 28S rRNA.][[0.0]]
[The transcription, post-transcriptional processing, and assembly of rRNA occurs in the nucleolus, aided by small nucleolar RNA -LRB-snoRNA-RRB- molecules, some of which are derived from spliced introns from messenger RNAs encoding genes related to ribosomal function.][[1.0]]
[The assembled ribosomal subunits are the largest structures passed through the nuclear pores.][[0.0]]
[When observed under the electron microscope, the nucleolus can be seen to consist of three distinguishable regions: the innermost fibrillar centers -LRB-FCs-RRB-, surrounded by the dense fibrillar component -LRB-DFC-RRB-, which in turn is bordered by the granular component -LRB-GC-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Transcription of the rDNA occurs either in the FC or at the FC-DFC boundary, and therefore when rDNA transcription in the cell is increased more FCs are detected.][[0.0]]
[Most of the cleavage and modification of rRNAs occurs in the DFC, while the latter steps involving protein assembly onto the ribosomal subunits occurs in the GC.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Other subnuclear bodies Besides the nucleolus, the nucleus contains a number of other non-membrane delineated bodies.][[1.0]]
[These include Cajal bodies, Gemini of coiled bodies, polymorphic interphase karyosomal association -LRB-PIKA-RRB-, promyelocytic leukaemia -LRB-PML-RRB- bodies, paraspeckles and splicing speckles.][[0.0]]
[Although little is known about a number of these domains, they are significant in that they show that the nucleoplasm is not uniform mixture, but rather contains organized functional subdomains.][[0.0]]
[Other subnuclear structures appear as part of abnormal disease processes.][[0.0]]
[For example, the presence of small intranuclear rods have been reported in some cases of nemaline myopathy.][[0.0]]
[This condition typically results from mutations in actin, and the rods themselves consist of mutant actin as well as other cytoskeletal proteins.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Cajal bodies and gems A nucleus typically contains between 1 and 10 compact structures called Cajal bodies or coiled bodies -LRB-CB-RRB-, whose diameter measures between 0.2�µm and 2.0�µm depending on the cell type and species.][[0.0]]
[When seen under an electron microscope, they resemble balls of tangled thread and are dense foci of distribution for the protein coilin.][[0.0]]
[CBs are involved in a number of different roles relating to RNA processing, specifically small nucleolar RNA -LRB-snoRNA-RRB- and small nuclear RNA -LRB-snRNA-RRB- maturation, and histone mRNA modification.][[0.0]]
[Similar to Cajal bodies are Gemini of coiled bodies, or gems, whose name is derived from the Gemini constellation in reference to their close ``twin'' relationship with CBs.][[0.0]]
[Gems are similar in size and shape to CBs, and in fact are virtually indistinguishable under the microscope.][[0.0]]
[Unlike CBs, gems do not contain small nuclear ribonucleoproteins -LRB-snRNPs-RRB-, but do contain a protein called survivor of motor neurons -LRB-SMN-RRB- whose function relates to snRNP biogenesis.][[0.0]]
[Gems are believed to assist CBs in snRNP biogenesis, though it has also been suggested from microscopy evidence that CBs and gems are different manifestations of the same structure.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- PIKA and PTF domains PIKA domains, or polymorphic interphase karyosomal associations, were first described in microscopy studies in 1991.][[0.0]]
[Their function was and remains unclear, though they were not thought to be associated with active DNA replication, transcription, or RNA processing.][[0.0]]
[They have been found to often associate with discrete domains defined by dense localization of the transcription factor PTF, which promotes transcription of snRNA.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- PML bodies Promyelocytic leukaemia bodies -LRB-PML bodies-RRB- are spherical bodies found scattered throughout the nucleoplasm, measuring around 0.2--1.0�µm.][[0.0]]
[They are known by a number of other names, including nuclear domain 10 -LRB-ND10-RRB-, Kremer bodies, and PML oncogenic domains.][[0.0]]
[They are often seen in the nucleus in association with Cajal bodies and cleavage bodies.][[0.0]]
[It has been suggested that they play a role in regulating transcription.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Paraspeckles Discovered by Fox et al. in 2002, paraspeckles are irregularly shaped compartments in the nucleus' interchromatin space.][[0.0]]
[First documented in HeLa cells, where there are generally 10--30 per nucleus, paraspeckles are now known to also exist in all human primary cells, transformed cell lines and tissue sections.][[0.0]]
[Their name is derived from their distribution in the nucleus; the ``para'' is short for parallel and the ``speckles'' refers to the splicing speckles to which they are always in close proximity.][[0.0]]
[Paraspeckles are dynamic structures that are altered in response to changes in cellular metabolic activity.][[0.0]]
[They are transcription dependent and in the absence of RNA Pol II transcription, the paraspeckle disappears and all of its associated protein components -LRB-PSP1, p54nrb, PSP2, CFI-LRB-m-RRB-68 and PSF-RRB- form a crescent shaped perinucleolar cap in the nucleolus.][[0.0]]
[This phenomenon is demonstrated during the cell cycle.][[0.0]]
[In the cell cycle, paraspeckles are present during interphase and during all of mitosis except for telophase.][[0.0]]
[During telophase, when the two daughter nuclei are formed, there is no RNA Pol II transcription so the protein components instead form a perinucleolar cap.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Splicing speckles Sometimes referred to as interchromatin granule clusters or as splicing-factor compartments, speckles are rich in splicing snRNPs and other splicing proteins necessary for pre-mRNA processing.][[0.0]]
[Because of a cell's changing requirements, the composition and location of these bodies changes according to mRNA transcription and regulation via phosphorylation of specific proteins.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Function The main function of the cell nucleus is to control gene expression and mediate the replication of DNA during the cell cycle.][[1.0]]
[The nucleus provides a site for genetic transcription that is segregated from the location of translation in the cytoplasm, allowing levels of gene regulation that are not available to prokaryotes.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Cell compartmentalization The nuclear envelope allows the nucleus to control its contents, and separate them from the rest of the cytoplasm where necessary.][[0.0]]
[This is important for controlling processes on either side of the nuclear membrane.][[0.0]]
[In some cases where a cytoplasmic process needs to be restricted, a key participant is removed to the nucleus, where it interacts with transcription factors to downregulate the production of certain enzymes in the pathway.][[0.0]]
[This regulatory mechanism occurs in the case of glycolysis, a cellular pathway for breaking down glucose to produce energy.][[0.0]]
[Hexokinase is an enzyme responsible for the first the step of glycolysis, forming glucose-6-phosphate from glucose.][[0.0]]
[At high concentrations of fructose-6-phosphate, a molecule made later from glucose-6-phosphate, a regulator protein removes hexokinase to the nucleus, where it forms a transcriptional repressor complex with nuclear proteins to reduce the expression of genes involved in glycolysis.][[0.0]]
[In order to control which genes are being transcribed, the cell separates some transcription factor proteins responsible for regulating gene expression from physical access to the DNA until they are activated by other signaling pathways.][[1.0]]
[This prevents even low levels of inappropriate gene expression.][[0.0]]
[For example in the case of NF-κB-controlled genes, which are involved in most inflammatory responses, transcription is induced in response to a signal pathway such as that initiated by the signaling molecule TNF-α, binds to a cell membrane receptor, resulting in the recruitment of signalling proteins, and eventually activating the transcription factor NF-κB.][[0.0]]
[A nuclear localisation signal on the NF-κB protein allows it to be transported through the nuclear pore and into the nucleus, where it stimulates the transcription of the target genes.][[0.0]]
[The compartmentalization allows the cell to prevent translation of unspliced mRNA.][[0.0]]
[Eukaryotic mRNA contains introns that must be removed before being translated to produce functional proteins.][[0.0]]
[The splicing is done inside the nucleus before the mRNA can be accessed by ribosomes for translation.][[0.0]]
[Without the nucleus ribosomes would translate newly transcribed -LRB-unprocessed-RRB- mRNA resulting in misformed and nonfunctional proteins.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Gene expression Gene expression first involves transcription, in which DNA is used as a template to produce RNA.][[0.0]]
[In the case of genes encoding proteins, that RNA produced from this process is messenger RNA -LRB-mRNA-RRB-, which then needs to be translated by ribosomes to form a protein.][[1.0]]
[As ribosomes are located outside the nucleus, mRNA produced needs to be exported.][[0.0]]
[Since the nucleus is the site of transcription, it also contains a variety of proteins which either directly mediate transcription or are involved in regulating the process.][[0.0]]
[These proteins include helicases that unwind the double-stranded DNA molecule to facilitate access to it, RNA polymerases that synthesize the growing RNA molecule, topoisomerases that change the amount of supercoiling in DNA, helping it wind and unwind, as well as a large variety of transcription factors that regulate expression.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Processing of pre-mRNA Newly synthesized mRNA molecules are known as primary transcripts or pre-mRNA.][[0.0]]
[They must undergo post-transcriptional modification in the nucleus before being exported to the cytoplasm; mRNA that appears in the nucleus without these modifications is degraded rather than used for protein translation.][[0.0]]
[The three main modifications are 5' capping, 3' polyadenylation, and RNA splicing.][[0.0]]
[While in the nucleus, pre-mRNA is associated with a variety of proteins in complexes known as heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particles -LRB-hnRNPs-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Addition of the 5' cap occurs co-transcriptionally and is the first step in post-transcriptional modification.][[0.0]]
[The 3' poly-adenine tail is only added after transcription is complete.][[0.0]]
[RNA splicing, carried out by a complex called the spliceosome, is the process by which introns, or regions of DNA that do not code for protein, are removed from the pre-mRNA and the remaining exons connected to re-form a single continuous molecule.][[0.0]]
[This process normally occurs after 5' capping and 3' polyadenylation but can begin before synthesis is complete in transcripts with many exons.][[0.0]]
[Many pre-mRNAs, including those encoding antibodies, can be spliced in multiple ways to produce different mature mRNAs that encode different protein sequences.][[0.0]]
[This process is known as alternative splicing, and allows production of a large variety of proteins from a limited amount of DNA.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Dynamics and regulation -LSB-edit-RSB- Nuclear transport The entry and exit of large molecules from the nucleus is tightly controlled by the nuclear pore complexes.][[0.0]]
[Although small molecules can enter the nucleus without regulation, macromolecules such as RNA and proteins require association karyopherins called importins to enter the nucleus and exportins to exit.][[0.0]]
[``Cargo'' proteins that must be translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus contain short amino acid sequences known as nuclear localization signals which are bound by importins, while those transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm carry nuclear export signals bound by exportins.][[0.0]]
[The ability of importins and exportins to transport their cargo is regulated by GTPases, enzymes that hydrolyze the molecule guanosine triphosphate to release energy.][[1.0]]
[The key GTPase in nuclear transport is Ran, which can bind either GTP or GDP -LRB-guanosine diphosphate-RRB- depending on whether it is located in the nucleus or the cytoplasm.][[0.0]]
[Whereas importins depend on RanGTP to dissociate from their cargo, exportins require RanGTP in order to bind to their cargo.][[0.0]]
[Nuclear import depends on the importin binding its cargo in the cytoplasm and carrying it through the nuclear pore into the nucleus.][[0.0]]
[Inside the nucleus, RanGTP acts to separate the cargo from the importin, allowing the importin to exit the nucleus and be reused.][[0.0]]
[Nuclear export is similar, as the exportin binds the cargo inside the nucleus in a process facilitated by RanGTP, exits through the nuclear pore, and separates from its cargo in the cytoplasm.][[0.0]]
[Specialized export proteins exist for translocation of mature mRNA and tRNA to the cytoplasm after post-transcriptional modification is complete.][[0.0]]
[This quality-control mechanism is important due to the these molecules' central role in protein translation; mis-expression of a protein due to incomplete excision of exons or mis-incorporation of amino acids could have negative consequences for the cell; thus incompletely modified RNA that reaches the cytoplasm is degraded rather than used in translation.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Assembly and disassembly During its lifetime a nucleus may be broken down, either in the process of cell division or as a consequence of apoptosis, a regulated form of cell death.][[0.0]]
[During these events, the structural components of the nucleus--the envelope and lamina--are systematically degraded.][[0.0]]
[During the cell cycle the cell divides to form two cells.][[0.0]]
[In order for this process to be possible, each of the new daughter cells must have a full set of genes, a process requiring replication of the chromosomes as well as segregation of the separate sets.][[0.0]]
[This occurs by the replicated chromosomes, the sister chromatids, attaching to microtubules, which in turn are attached to different centrosomes.][[0.0]]
[The sister chromatids can then be pulled to separate locations in the cell.][[0.0]]
[In many cells the centrosome is located in the cytoplasm, outside the nucleus, the microtubules would be unable to attach to the chromatids in the presence of the nuclear envelope.][[0.0]]
[Therefore the early stages in the cell cycle, beginning in prophase and until around prometaphase, the nuclear membrane is dismantled.][[0.0]]
[Likewise, during the same period, the nuclear lamina is also disassembled, a process regulated by phosphorylation of the lamins.][[0.0]]
[Towards the end of the cell cycle, the nuclear membrane is reformed, and around the same time, the nuclear lamina are reassembled by dephosphorylating the lamins.][[0.0]]
[However, in dinoflagellates the nuclear envelope remains intact, the centrosomes are located in the cytoplasm, and the microtubules come in contact with chromosomes, whose centromeric regions are incorporated into the nuclear envelope -LRB-the so-called closed mitosis with extranuclear spindle-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[In many other protists -LRB-e.g. ciliates, sporozoans-RRB- and fungi the centrosomes are intranuclear, and their nuclear envelope also does not disassemle during cell division.][[0.0]]
[Apoptosis is a controlled process in which the cell's structural components are destroyed, resulting in death of the cell.][[0.0]]
[Changes associated with apoptosis directly affect the nucleus and its contents, for example in the condensation of chromatin and the disintegration of the nuclear envelope and lamina.][[0.0]]
[The destruction of the lamin networks is controlled by specialized apoptotic proteases called caspases, which cleave the lamin proteins and thus degrade the nucleus' structural integrity.][[0.0]]
[Lamin cleavage is sometimes used as a laboratory indicator of caspase activity in assays for early apoptotic activity.][[0.0]]
[Cells that express mutant caspase-resistant lamins are deficient in nuclear changes related to apoptosis, suggesting that lamins play a role in initiating the events that lead to apoptotic degradation of the nucleus.][[0.0]]
[Inhibition of lamin assembly itself is an inducer of apoptosis.][[0.0]]
[The nuclear envelope acts as a barrier that prevents both DNA and RNA viruses from entering the nucleus.][[0.0]]
[Some viruses require access to proteins inside the nucleus in order to replicate and/or assemble.][[0.0]]
[DNA viruses, such as herpesvirus replicate and assemble in the cell nucleus, and exit by budding through the inner nuclear membrane.][[0.0]]
[This process is accompanied by disassembly of the lamina on the nuclear face of the inner membrane.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Anucleated and polynucleated cells Although most cells have a single nucleus, some eukaryotic cell types have no nucleus, and others have many nuclei.][[0.0]]
[This can be a normal process, as in the maturation of mammalian red blood cells, or a result of faulty cell division.][[0.0]]
[Anucleated cells contain no nucleus and are therefore incapable of dividing to produce daughter cells.][[0.0]]
[The best-known anucleated cell is the mammalian red blood cell, or erythrocyte, which also lacks other organelles such as mitochondria and serves primarily as a transport vessel to ferry oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues.][[0.0]]
[Erythrocytes mature through erythropoiesis in the bone marrow, where they lose their nuclei, organelles, and ribosomes.][[0.0]]
[The nucleus is expelled during the process of differentiation from an erythroblast to a reticulocyte, which is the immediate precursor of the mature erythrocyte.][[0.0]]
[The presence of mutagens may induce the release of some immature ``micronucleated'' erythrocytes into the bloodstream.][[0.0]]
[Anucleated cells can also arise from flawed cell division in which one daughter lacks a nucleus and the other has two nuclei.][[0.0]]
[Polynucleated cells contain multiple nuclei.][[0.0]]
[Most Acantharean species of protozoa and some fungi in mycorrhizae have naturally polynucleated cells.][[0.0]]
[Other examples include the intestinal parasites in the genus Giardia, which have two nuclei per cell.][[0.0]]
[In humans, skeletal muscle cells, called myocytes, become polynucleated during development; the resulting arrangement of nuclei near the periphery of the cells allows maximal intracellular space for myofibrils.][[0.0]]
[Multinucleated cells can also be abnormal in humans; for example, cells arising from the fusion of monocytes and macrophages, known as giant multinucleated cells, sometimes accompany inflammation and are also implicated in tumor formation.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Evolution As the major defining characteristic of the eukaryotic cell, the nucleus' evolutionary origin has been the subject of much speculation.][[0.0]]
[Four major theories have been proposed to explain the existence of the nucleus, although none have yet earned widespread support.][[0.0]]
[The theory known as the ``syntrophic model'' proposes that a symbiotic relationship between the archaea and bacteria created the nucleus-containing eukaryotic cell.][[0.0]]
[It is hypothesized that the symbiosis originated when ancient archaea, similar to modern methanogenic archaea, invaded and lived within bacteria similar to modern myxobacteria, eventually forming the early nucleus.][[0.0]]
[This theory is analogous to the accepted theory for the origin of eukaryotic mitochondria and chloroplasts, which are thought to have developed from a similar endosymbiotic relationship between proto-eukaryotes and aerobic bacteria.][[0.0]]
[The archaeal origin of the nucleus is supported by observations that archaea and eukarya have similar genes for certain proteins, including histones.][[0.0]]
[Observations that myxobacteria are motile, can form multicellular complexes, and possess kinases and G proteins similar to eukarya, support a bacterial origin for the eukaryotic cell.][[0.0]]
[A second model proposes that proto-eukaryotic cells evolved from bacteria without an endosymbiotic stage.][[0.0]]
[This model is based on the existence of modern planctomycetes bacteria that possess a nuclear structure with primitive pores and other compartmentalized membrane structures.][[1.0]]
[A similar proposal states that a eukaryote-like cell, the chronocyte, evolved first and phagocytosed archaea and bacteria to generate the nucleus and the eukaryotic cell.][[0.0]]
[The most controversial model, known as viral eukaryogenesis, posits that the membrane-bound nucleus, along with other eukaryotic features, originated from the infection of a prokaryote by a virus.][[0.0]]
[The suggestion is based on similarities between eukaryotes and viruses such as linear DNA strands, mRNA capping, and tight binding to proteins -LRB-analogizing histones to viral envelopes-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[One version of the proposal suggests that the nucleus evolved in concert with phagocytosis to form an early cellular ``predator''.][[0.0]]
[Another variant proposes that eukaryotes originated from early archaea infected by poxviruses, on the basis of observed similarity between the DNA polymerases in modern poxviruses and eukaryotes.][[0.0]]
[It has been suggested that the unresolved question of the evolution of sex could be related to the viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis.][[0.0]]
[Finally, a very recent proposal suggests that traditional variants of the endosymbiont theory are insufficiently powerful to explain the origin of the eukaryotic nucleus.][[0.0]]
[This model, termed the exomembrane hypothesis, suggests that the nucleus instead originated from a single ancestral cell that evolved a second exterior cell membrane; the interior membrane enclosing the original cell then became the nuclear membrane and evolved increasingly elaborate pore structures for passage of internally synthesized cellular components such as ribosomal subunits.][[1.0]]

[-LSB-edit-RSB- History In the mid-1770s, the British government levied taxes that impeded Providence's maritime, fishing and agricultural industries, the mainstay of the city's economy.][[0.0]]
[One example was the Sugar Act, which was a tax levied against Providence's distilleries that adversely affected its trade in rum and slaves.][[0.0]]
[These taxes caused Providence to join the other colonies in renouncing allegiance to the British Crown.][[0.0]]
[In response to enforcement of unpopular trade laws, Providence residents spilled the first blood of the American Revolution in the notorious Gaspée Affair of 1772.][[0.0]]
[Though during the Revolutionary War the city escaped enemy occupation, the capture of nearby Newport disrupted industry and kept the population on alert.][[0.0]]
[Troops were quartered for various campaigns and Brown University's University Hall was used as a barracks and military hospital.][[0.0]]
[After departing from Newport, French troops sent by King Louis XVI and commanded by the Comte de Rochambeau passed through Providence on their way to join the attack against British forces.][[0.0]]
[The march from Newport to Providence was the beginning of a campaign led jointly by General George Washington in a decisive march that ended with the defeat of General Cornwallis in the Siege of Yorktown at Yorktown, Virginia and the Battle of the Chesapeake.][[0.0]]
[Following the war, the economy shifted from maritime endeavors to manufacturing, particularly machinery, tools, silverware, jewelry and textiles.][[0.0]]
[At one time, Providence boasted some of the largest manufacturing plants in the country, including Brown & Sharpe, Nicholson File, and Gorham Silverware, and with 7,614 people, was the country's ninth-largest city.b-LSB-'-RSB- The city's industries attracted many immigrants from Ireland, Germany, Sweden, England, Italy, Portugal, Cape Verde, and French Canada.][[0.0]]
[Economic and demographic shifts caused social strife, notably with a series of race riots between whites and blacks during the 1820s.][[0.0]]
[In response to these troubles and the economic growth, Providence residents ratified a city charter in 1831 as the population passed 17,000.][[0.0]]
[During the Civil War, local politics split over slavery as many had ties to Southern cotton.][[0.0]]
[Despite ambivalence concerning the war, the number of military volunteers routinely exceeded quota, and the city's manufacturing proved invaluable to the Union.][[0.0]]
[Postwar, horsecar lines covering the city enabled its growth and Providence thrived with waves of immigrants and land annexations bringing the population from 54,595 in 1865 to 175,597 by 1900.][[0.0]]

[-LSB-edit-RSB- Plot The film opens with a series of grainy, color-warped still photographs appearing over melancholy piano music, representing the abstract memories of the unseen Herman Raucher -LRB-Robert Mulligan narrating in voiceover-RRB-, a middle-aged man from Brooklyn.][[0.0]]
[After the stills finish, we hear Raucher speaking in the present day -LRB-1971 according to the book-RRB-, recalling the summer he spent on the island -LRB-fictionalized in the novel as ``Packett Island''-RRB- in 1942.][[0.0]]
[The film flashes back to a day that then 15-year-old ``Hermie'' -LRB-Gary Grimes-RRB- and his friends�-- jock Oscy -LRB-Jerry Houser-RRB- and introverted nerd Benjie -LRB-Oliver Conant-RRB-�-- spent running and playing on the beach.][[0.0]]
[In the middle of their goofing off, the three boys spot a newlywed young soldier carrying his bride -LRB-Jennifer O'Neill-RRB- into a house on the beach.][[0.0]]
[The boys are all struck by her beauty, especially Hermie, who finds himself unable to get her out of his mind.][[0.0]]
[The next several days on the island find the boys continuing to spend their afternoons on the beach, where, in the midst of young, scantily-clad teenage girls, their thoughts invariably turn to sex; all of them are virgins, the height of their experience being when Oscy and Hermie touched a girl's breasts when they were twelve.][[0.0]]
[While Oscy is more interested in sex with gorgeous girls, however, Hermie finds himself developing genuine romantic interest in the young bride, whose husband he spots leaving the island on a military transport boat one morning.][[0.0]]
[Later that day, Hermie spots her trying to carry numerous bags of groceries by herself, and helps her get them back to her house.][[0.0]]
[The two strike up a friendship and he agrees to return in the future to help her out with chores.][[0.0]]
[Meanwhile, Benjie mentions that one of the books kept in the beach house his parents are renting is a sex manual.][[0.0]]
[Oscy and Hermie convince the reluctant Benjie to steal the book; upon reading it, Oscy and Hermie become convinced they now know everything necessary to lose their virginity and become great lovers.][[0.0]]
[They decide to put this hypothesis to the test by going to the island film house and picking up a trio of girls; Oscy happens to find three high-school girls, and sets about staking out the most attractive one, Miriam -LRB-Christopher Norris-RRB-, for himself, ``giving'' Hermie her wallflower friend, Aggie -LRB-Katherine Allentuck-RRB- and leaving Benjie with Gloria, a heavyset girl with braces.][[1.0]]
[Frightened by the reality of the concept of sex, Benjie runs away into the night, and is not seen by Hermie or Oscy again the whole summer.][[0.0]]
[Gloria, thinking that her appearance repulsed Benjie, likewise walks away.][[0.0]]
[Hermie and Oscy spend the entirety of the film -LRB-Now, Voyager - an anachronism, as that film wasn't released until October 1942-RRB- attempting to ``score'' with Miriam and Aggie, Oscy aggressively pursuing Miriam to the point that she strikes him, although Oscy soon learns that she is the island ``hussy'' and simply playing hard to get.][[0.0]]
[Hermie, meanwhile, finds himself getting unexpected success with Aggie, who allows him to grope her breast for almost twelve minutes; it isn't until after the show Oscy points out to Hermie the reason for Aggie's passivity was that Hermie was in fact fondling her elbow.][[0.0]]
[The following morning, Hermie helps the young bride move boxes into her attic, and when he turns down her offer of monetary compensation, she thanks him for his honesty and friendship and gives him a kiss on the forehead.][[0.0]]
[Later, in preparation for a marshmallow roast on the beach with Aggie and Miriam, Hermie and Oscy make carbon copies from the sex manual; then Hermie goes to the local drugstore, and in a protracted sequence attempts to build up the nerve to ask the pharmacist for condoms.][[0.0]]
[He eventually does so, after purchasing some ice cream, telling the pharmacist that the condoms are for his ``brother'' and he thinks that they are, in fact, a type of water balloon.][[0.0]]
[That night, during the marshmallow roast, Hermie finds himself unable to ``put the moves'' on Aggie, although Oscy is successful in having sex with Miriam between some sand dunes; he is so successful, in fact, he eventually sneaks over to where Hermie and Aggie are roasting marshmallows and asks Hermie to give him some condoms, having run out of his own.][[0.0]]
[Confused as to what's happening, Aggie follows Oscy back between the dunes, where she sees him having sex with Miriam and runs home crying.][[0.0]]
[Hermie, too, sees the act, although he is more mesmerized than anything.][[0.0]]
[The next day, Hermie comes across the young bride sitting outside her house, writing a letter to her husband.][[0.0]]
[Hermie offers to come keep her company that night and she says she looks forward to seeing him, finally revealing that her name is Dorothy.][[0.0]]
[An elated Hermie goes home and puts on a suit, saddle shoes, and a dress shirt, and heads back to Dorothy's house, running into Oscy on the way; Oscy relates Miriam's appendix burst that morning and she's been rushed to the mainland.][[0.0]]
[Hermie, now convinced he is at the brink of adulthood because of his relationship with Dorothy, brushes Oscy off and the two get into a fight.][[0.0]]
[Oscy threatens to tell everyone on the island that Hermie is a homosexual, and storms off.][[0.0]]
[Hermie heads over to Dorothy's house, which he finds eerily quiet.][[0.0]]
[Sneaking in, he discovers an empty bottle of whiskey, several cigarette butts, and a telegram from the U.S. Government, with a time stamp of just an hour prior, saying that Dorothy's husband is dead, his plane having been shot down over France.][[0.0]]
[Dorothy comes out of her bedroom, crying, and Hermie comforts her.][[0.0]]
[She moves to the record player and turns on an album and invites Hermie to dance with her.][[0.0]]

[Hermie leaves, his last image of Dorothy being that of her leaning against the railing, as she smokes a cigarette and stares off into the night sky.][[0.0]]
[Hermie spends the entire night roaming the island in a state of shock.][[0.0]]
[At dawn he meets Oscy and the two share a silent moment of reconciliation, broken only by Oscy's informing Hermie that Miriam survived her appendix bursting but will remain hospitalized until autumn.][[0.0]]
[Sensing that something traumatic has occurred between Hermie and Dorothy, Oscy, in an uncharacteristic act of sensitivity, lets Hermie be by himself, departing with the words, ``Sometimes life is just one big pain in the ass.''][[0.0]]
[Hermie goes back to Dorothy's house to try to sort out what has happened; he finds it abandoned, Dorothy having fled the island in the night.][[0.0]]
[All that remains is an envelope tacked to her front door with Hermie's name on it.][[1.0]]
[Hermie opens it; inside is a note from Dorothy, saying that she hopes he understands that she must go back home to arrange her husband's funeral and deal with familial obligations.][[0.0]]
[She assures Hermie that she will never forget him, and that she hopes one day he will come to terms with what happened that night.][[0.0]]
[Her note closes with the hope that Hermie may be spared the senseless tragedies of life.][[0.0]]
[In the film's final scene, Hermie is seen looking at Dorothy's old house and the ocean and remembering the day that he, Oscy, and Benjie first saw her, as the adult Herman Raucher sadly recounts that in the ensuing years he has never seen Dorothy again or learned what became of her.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Factual basis The film -LRB-and subsequent novel-RRB- were memoirs written by Herman Raucher; they detailed the events in his life over the course of the summer he spent on Nantucket Island in 1942 when he was fourteen years old.][[1.0]]
[Originally, the film was meant to be a tribute to his friend Oscar ``Oscy'' Seltzer, an Army medic killed in the Korean War.][[0.0]]
[Seltzer was shot dead on a battlefield in Korea whilst attending to a wounded man; this happened on Raucher's birthday, and consequently, Raucher has not celebrated a birthday since.][[0.0]]
[During the course of writing the screenplay, Raucher came to the realization that despite growing up with Oscy and having bonded with him through their formative years, the two had never really had any meaningful conversations or gotten to know one another on a more personal level.][[0.0]]
[Instead, Raucher decided to focus on the first major adult experience of his life, that of falling in love for the first time.][[0.0]]
[The woman -LRB-named Dorothy, like her screen counterpart-RRB- was a fellow vacationer on the island whom Raucher had befriended one day when he helped her carry groceries home; he became a friend of her and her husband and helped her with chores after her husband was called to fight in World War II.][[1.0]]
[Raucher went to bed with her one night when he came to visit her, arriving only minutes after she received notification of her husband's death.][[0.0]]
[The next morning, Raucher discovered that she had left the island, leaving behind a note for him -LRB-which is read at the end of the film and reproduced in the book-RRB-.][[1.0]]
[He never saw her again; his last ``encounter'' with her, recounted on an episode of The Mike Douglas Show, came after the film's release in 1971, when she was one of over a dozen women who wrote letters to Raucher claiming to be ``his'' Dorothy.][[0.0]]
[Raucher recognized the ``real'' Dorothy's handwriting, and she confirmed her identity by making references to certain events only she could have known about.][[0.0]]
[She told Raucher that she had lived for years with the guilt that she had potentially traumatized him and ruined his life.][[0.0]]
[She told Raucher that she was glad he turned out all right, and that they had best not re-visit the past.][[0.0]]
[In a 2002 interview, Raucher lamented never hearing from her again and expressed his hope that she was still alive.][[0.0]]
[Raucher's novelization of the screenplay, with the dedication, ``To those I love, past and present,'' serves more as the tribute to Seltzer that he had intended the film to be, with the focus of the book being more on the two boys' relationship than Raucher's relationship with Dorothy.][[0.0]]
[Consequently, the book also mentions Seltzer's death, which is omitted from the film adaptation.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Production Herman Raucher wrote the film script in the 1950s during his tenure as a television writer, but ``couldn't give it away.''][[0.0]]
[In the 1960s, he met Robert Mulligan, who had just finished directing To Kill a Mockingbird.][[0.0]]
[Raucher showed Mulligan the script, and Mulligan took it to Warner Bros., knowing that the studio was looking for a follow up to Mockingbird.][[0.0]]
[Mulligan argued the film could be shot for the relatively low price of a million dollars, and Warner approved it.][[0.0]]
[They had so little faith in the film becoming a box-office success, though, they shied from paying Raucher outright for the script, instead promising him ten percent of the gross.][[0.0]]
[When casting for the role of Dorothy, Warner Bros. declined to audition any actresses younger than the age of thirty; Jennifer O'Neill's agent, who had developed a fondness for the script, convinced Warner Bros. to audition his client, who was only twenty-two at the time.][[0.0]]
[O'Neill auditioned for the role, albeit hesitantly, not wanting to perform any nude scenes; O'Neill ended up getting the role and Robert Mulligan agreed to find a way to make the film work without blatant nudity.][[1.0]]
[Though the film took place on Nantucket, by the 1970s the island was too far modernized to be convincingly transformed to resemble a 1940s resort, so production was taken to the West Coast of the United States.][[0.0]]
[Shooting took place over eight weeks, during which Jennifer O'Neill was sequestered from the three boys cast as ``The Terrible Trio,'' in order to ensure that they didn't become close and ruin the sense of awkwardness and distance that their characters felt towards Dorothy.][[0.0]]
[Production ran smoothly, finishing on schedule.][[0.0]]
[After production, Warner Bros., still wary about the film only being a minor success, asked Raucher to adapt his script into a book.][[0.0]]
[Raucher wrote it in three weeks, and Warner Bros. released it prior to the film to build interest in the story.][[0.0]]
[The book quickly became a national bestseller, so that when trailers premiered in theatres, the film was billed as being ``based on the national bestseller,'' despite the film having been completed first.][[0.0]]
[Ultimately, the book became one of the best selling novels of the first half of the 1970s, requiring 23 re-prints between 1971 and 1974 to keep up with customer demand.][[1.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Soundtrack The film's soundtrack consists almost entirely of compositions by Michel Legrand, many of which are variants upon ``The Summer Knows'', the film's theme.][[0.0]]
[In addition to Legrand's scoring, the film also features the song ``Hold Tight'' by The Andrews Sisters and the theme from Now, Voyager.][[0.0]]
[Due to this lack of songs, when the soundtrack was released, it contained not only the score to Summer, but also Legrand's composition ``The Picasso Suite.''][[0.0]]
[In spite of this, many issues of the album are still labeled as exclusively being the soundtrack to Summer, while others contain the notation in small print on the album cover ``Also contains `The Picasso Suite'''.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Reception and awards The film became a blockbuster upon its release, grossing twenty-five million dollars, making it the fourth highest grossing film of 1971 and one of the most successful films in history, with an expense to profit ratio of 1:25; beyond that, it is estimated video rentals and purchases in the United States since the 1980s have produced an additional $20.5 million dollars.][[0.0]]
[On this point, Raucher says his ten-percent of the gross, in addition to royalties from book sales, has ``paid bills ever since.''][[0.0]]
[As well as being a commercial success, Summer of '42 also received rave critical reviews.][[0.0]]
[It went on to be nominated for over a dozen awards, including Golden Globe Awards for ``Best Motion Picture - Drama'' and ``Best Director'', and the Academy Award for ``Best Original Screenplay''.][[0.0]]
[Ultimately, the film only won two awards, the ``Best Score'' Oscar'' and the BAFTA Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, both to Michel Legrand.][[0.0]]
[Still, it counted among its fans Stanley Kubrick, who in a rare moment of pop-culture infusion into his films, had the film play on a television in a scene in The Shining.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Sequel In 1973, the film was followed up with a sequel, Class of '44, a slice-of-life film made up of vignettes about Herman Raucher and Oscar Selzter's experiences in college prior to fighting in the Korean War.][[0.0]]
[The only crew member left from Summer of '42 was Raucher himself, with a new director and composer being brought in to replace Mulligan and Legrand.][[0.0]]
[Of the principal four cast members of Summer of '42, only Jerry Houser and Gary Grimes returned for prominent roles.][[1.0]]
[Oliver Conant did appear in the film, albeit for less than five minutes of screen time.][[0.0]]
[Jennifer O'Neill did not appear in the film at all, nor was the character of Dorothy mentioned.][[0.0]]
[The film met with poor critical reviews; the only three reviews available at rottentomatoes.com are resoundingly negative, with Channel 4 calling it ``a big disappointment,'' and The New York Times stating ``The only things worth attention in `Class of 44' are the period details,'' and ''`Class of '44' seems less like a movie than 95 minutes of animated wallpaper.''][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Influence Legrand's theme song for the film, ``The Summer Knows'', has since become a pop standard, being recorded by such artists as Peter Nero -LRB-who had a charting hit with his 1971 version-RRB-, Tony Bennett, Frank Sinatra, Andy Williams, and Barbra Streisand.][[0.0]]
[The 1973 song ``Summer -LRB-The First Time-RRB-'' by Bobby Goldsboro has almost exactly the same subject and apparent setting, although there is no direct credited link.][[0.0]]
[Bryan Adams has, however, credited the film as being a partial inspiration for his 1985 hit ``Summer of '69''.][[0.0]]
[The Simpsons episode ``Summer of 4 Ft. 2'' -LRB-alternately titled `Summer of 4'2'''-RRB- was largely a parody of Summer of '42.][[0.0]]
[It amalgamated scenes from another early '70s coming-of-age film, American Graffiti -LRB-both acknowledged in the DVD commentary for the episode-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[There are also similarities between Summer of '42 and Malèna, another coming-of-age film set in the context of World War II, and starring Monica Bellucci and Giuseppe Sulfaro.][[0.0]]
[An episode of the 1970s sitcom Happy Days was loosely based upon Summer of '42, with Richie Cunningham befriending a Korean War widow.][[0.0]]
[In Family Guy episode ``Play It Again, Brian'', Brian wins an award for his essay and reads an excerpt: ``She was Grace, in name and in essence.][[0.0]]
[To those she loved, she exuded strength, life, laughter and light, and to me, also sorrow for circumstance that had bound her to my best friend through whom we met in the warmth and serenity of her home.][[0.0]]
[Nothing from the first day I saw her and no one that has happened to me since, has ever been as frightning and as confusing, for no person I've ever known has ever done more to make me feel more sure, more insecure, more important and less significant.''][[0.0]]
[Later in that episode, he admits that he ``ripped off'' most of the essay from Summer of '42.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Remakes and re-releases In the ensuing years since the film's release, Warner Bros. has attempted to buy back Raucher's ten-percent of the film as well as his rights to the story so it could be remade; Raucher has consistently declined.][[0.0]]
[The 1988 film Stealing Home shares numerous similarities not only to Summer of '42 but also Class of '44, with several incidents -LRB-most notably a subplot dealing with the premature death of the protagonist's father and the protagonist's response to it-RRB- appearing to have been directly lifted from Raucher's own life; Jennifer O'Neill stated in 2002 she believes ``Home'' was an attempted remake of ``Summer''.][[0.0]]
[In 2001, Raucher consented to the film being made into an off Broadway musical play.][[0.0]]
[He was on hand opening night, giving the cast a pep-talk which he concluded, ``We've now done it every possible way--except go out and piss it in the snow!''][[0.0]]
[The play met with positive critical and fan response, and was endorsed by Raucher himself, but the play was forced to close down in the aftermath of the 11 September attacks.][[0.0]]
[Nevertheless, the play was enough to spark interest in the film and book with a new generation, prompting Warner to re-issue the book -LRB-which had since gone out of print, along with all of Raucher's other works-RRB- for sale with Barnes & Noble's online bookstore, and to restore the film and release it on DVD.][[1.0]]

[-LSB-edit-RSB- Grand Staircase The rocks exposed in Bryce Canyon are about 100 million years younger than those in nearby Zion National Park, and the rocks exposed in Zion are younger than those in the Grand Canyon to the south.][[1.0]]
[There are, however, shared rock units between all three, creating a supersequence of formations that geologists call the Grand Staircase.][[1.0]]
[Together the formations of the Grand Staircase record nearly 2000 million years of the Earth's history.][[0.0]]

[-LSB-edit-RSB- Cretaceous Seaway -LSB-edit-RSB- Advance In the Cretaceous a shallow seaway spread into the interior of North America from the Gulf of Mexico in the south into Utah and later to the Arctic Ocean in the far north.][[0.0]]
[Geologists call this shallow sea the Cretaceous Seaway or Western Interior Seaway.][[0.0]]
[Whatever its name, the seaway divided North America into two halves; an eastern portion dominated by the already ancient Appalachian Mountains and a western part composed primarily of the still growing Sevier Mountains; formed from shallow thrust faulting caused by the Sevier orogeny.][[1.0]]
[As the shoreline moved back and forth, the Bryce area alternated from being part of the Sevier landmass to being under the Cretaceous Seaway.][[1.0]]
[Alternating layers of nonmarine, intertidal, and marine sediments lay on top of each other as a result.][[0.0]]
[Conglomerate, siltstone, and fossil-rich sandstone that together are up to 300�feet -LRB-90�m-RRB- thick mark the arrival of the Cretaceous Seaway.][[0.0]]
[Called the Dakota Sandstone, it is the oldest formation exposed in the Bryce Canyon area but the youngest one exposed in the Zion and Kolob canyons area to the southwest.][[0.0]]
[Abundant amounts of petrified wood, oyster beds containing millions of fossils and coal are all found in the Dakota.][[0.0]]
[In the Bryce Canyon area this formation can be seen in the Paria Valley where it is found as a lithified blanket sand that probably accumulated on beaches, in lagoons, and vast coal-producing swamps as the Cretaceous Seaway transgressed -LRB-advanced inland-RRB- over the region and later retreated.][[1.0]]
[It sits unconformably on much older Jurassic formations that are not exposed in the immediate area -LRB-see geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area for a discussion about these older sediments-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Mud and silt were deposited on top of the Dakota Formation as the seaway became deeper and calmer in the area.][[0.0]]
[The resulting dark gray to black Tropic Shale records the maximum transgression of the seaway into Utah and is 1,000�feet -LRB-300�m-RRB- thick in the Paria Amphitheater.][[0.0]]
[It forms the unvegetated badlands seen in the Tropic Valley and is perhaps the most fossil-rich formation in the area; containing numerous straight-shelled and coiled ammonites.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Retreat The Cretaceous Seaway was already retreating east and to the south by the time the locally 1,700�feet -LRB-520�m-RRB- thick Straight Cliffs Formation was deposited.][[0.0]]
[Its members represent various stages in this process.][[0.0]]
[The cliff-forming sandstone of the Tibbet Canyon Member was conformably deposited on top of the Tropic Shale in shallow marine and later near shore environments.][[1.0]]
[Shale and sandstone from the Smoky Hollow Member were deposited on top of its basal layer of coal-rich mudstone in coastal swamps and lagoons on the shore of the seaway.][[0.0]]
[While the alternating layers of shale and sandstone mixed with massive coal deposits of the John Henry Member were laid down in swamps, lagoons and fluvial environments one member, the Drip Tank, is not found in the Bryce Canyon area.][[0.0]]
[This formation erodes into almost unclimbable cliffs and escarpments of whitish to yellow-gray sandstones with comparatively thin interbedded layers of shale and mudstone.][[0.0]]
[Shark teeth are found in the lower parts of the formation.][[0.0]]
[Lakes and east-flowing rivers became the dominant resting place for sediment following the retreat of the Cretaceous Seaway.][[0.0]]
[The shales and sandstones of the locally 700�feet -LRB-210�m-RRB- thick Wahweap Formation were deposited in moving water -LRB-fluvial setting-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[This formation is part of the Grey Cliffs of the Grand Staircase mentioned previously.][[0.0]]
[It contains abundant fossils of vertebrates, including dinosaurs such as the hadrosaurs.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Continental deposition -LSB-edit-RSB- Flood plains uplift and erode A flood plain crossed by rivers and lakes developed in the area.][[0.0]]
[Mud and sand accumulated in this setting to become the gray sandstones and mudstones of the Kaiparowits Formation.][[0.0]]
[This formation is up to 100�feet -LRB-30�m-RRB- thick in the Bryce Canyon area but other parts of the Kaiparowits in the region are several hundreds of feet -LRB-tens of meters-RRB- thick.][[0.0]]
[Two formations, the Canaan Peak and the Pine Hollow, sit on top of the Kaiparowits elsewhere in the region but are absent in the Bryce Canyon area.][[0.0]]
[The sandstones and conglomerates of these formations record stream and river deposition starting in the Paleocene epoch.][[0.0]]
[Uplift caused by a mountain-building episode called the Laramide orogeny lasted from the late Cretaceous around 70�mya to the early Paleocene.][[1.0]]
[This hoisted the once lower uplands skyward while low-lying basins between them gradually subsided.][[0.0]]
[Compression from the Laramide event deformed the land in the area to form the up to 5° dipping Bryce Canyon Anticline.][[0.0]]
[All of the Canaan Peak, Pine Hollow, Kaiparowits, and Waheap formations, along with part of the underlying Straight Cliffs, were removed from the anticline's crest by erosion before the Claron Formation was deposited.][[0.0]]
[An angular unconformity therefore exists along the anticline's crest.][[0.0]]
[The park also sits on the western gently dipping flank of the much larger Kaibab uplift, which was also formed as a result of the Laramide.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Claron flood plain and lake system Uplift from the Laramide paused briefly in the Eocene.][[0.0]]
[Meandering streams flowed slowly over the resulting broad and almost featureless plains.][[0.0]]
[Periodic but extensive floods inundated large areas perhaps once every 1,000 years; spreading mud, cobbles and fine silt over the plains.][[0.0]]
[Erosion incised these deposits between flood events and plant growth was abundant.][[0.0]]
[Oxidation of the iron in the mud and silt turned the soil into hematite, giving it a pink and red hue.][[0.0]]
[These sediments were later lithified into the up to 700�feet -LRB-210�m-RRB- thick Pink Member of the locally Eocene-aged Claron Formation -LRB-previously called the Wasatch Formation-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Channelized conglomerates of this member can be easily seen in Red Canyon along State Route 12 while its silt and mudstones compose most of the park's fragile and colorful spires called hoodoos.][[0.0]]
[Geologist Clarence Dutton called the iron oxide-rich lower member of the Claron the Pink Cliffs series due to its colorful appearance.][[0.0]]
[A large system of shallow but expansive lakes and associated deltas covered several thousand square miles of what is now northwest Colorado and southwest Utah and Wyoming.][[0.0]]
[These lakes existed from the Paleocene to mid Oligocene but did not spread to the Bryce Canyon area until Eocene time.][[0.0]]
[Large quantities of lakebed sediments were laid down in this system during the 20 million years of its existence from about 60 to 40�mya.][[0.0]]
[Climate change and cycles caused the lakes in the system to expand and shrink through time.][[0.0]]
[As they did so, they left beds of differing thickness and composition stacked atop one another;  The limey ooses and mud were later lithified into the limestone and interbedded siltstone of the up to 300�foot -LRB-90�m-RRB- thick White Member of the Claron.][[0.0]]
[This member erodes into white-colored monoliths that are only found at the highest elevations of the Paunsaugunt Plateau.][[0.0]]
[Fossils are rare in the White Member and mainly consist of freshwater snails and clams, indicating that the lakes supported little life.][[0.0]]
[Most arches and natural bridges in the park, including the famous Natural Bridge, were carved from sandstone beds in the Claron.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Marysvale volcanics A gap in the geologic record following deposition of the Claron Formation was interrupted 34 to 31�mya by eruptions from the nearby Marysvale volcanic field, which is located northwest of the park.][[0.0]]
[Volcanic ash and lava from these flows are found less than 20�miles -LRB-30�km-RRB- from Bryce Canyon but at least some volcanic material was likely deposited directly in the park area only to be later removed by erosion.][[0.0]]
[Most of the activity at the Marysvale volcanic field occurred during three separate intervals; ~34--22�mya, 22--14�mya and 9--5�mya.][[0.0]]
[Dacites and andesites were erupted above an evolving batholith in the first interval.][[0.0]]
[Crystal-rich ash from the 27�million year old -LRB-myo-RRB- Three Creeks caldera, 24�myo Big John caldera and 23�myo Monroe Peak caldera hardened into tuff.][[0.0]]
[The second and third intervals saw eruptions of great quantities of rhyolites.][[0.0]]
[Alkali-rich rhyolite erupted in the second interval from the 19�myo Mount Belknap caldera.][[0.0]]
[The Marysvale volcanic field collapsed under its own weight around 20�mya; likely due to weaknesses in the evaporites of the Carmel Formation some 5,000�feet -LRB-1,500�m-RRB- below.][[0.0]]
[Folding and faulting of the Claron Formation from the collapse created Ruby's Inn thrust.][[0.0]]
[A slight downwarp running east--west and perpendicular to the thrust motion called the Bryce syncline was also created.][[0.0]]
[Volcanic activity in the Marysvale and Bryce area ceased some 500,000 years ago.][[0.0]]
[Basaltic rocks of the same age can be seen along the Sevier Fault near the entrance to Red Canyon; the dark colored volcanic rocks have been displaced by the fault some 900�feet -LRB-300�m-RRB- and are now in direct contact with the much older Claron Formation.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Late Cenozoic tectonics -LSB-edit-RSB- Formation of the High Plateaus Younger rock units were laid down but were mostly removed by subsequent uplift-accelerated erosion.][[0.0]]
[Outcrops of these formations can be found in the northern part of the park and in a few places on the plateau rim.][[0.0]]
[Among these are the 50- to 100-foot-thick -LRB-15 to 30�m-RRB- Oligocene or Miocene-aged Boat Mesa Conglomerate and the Pliocene to early Pleistocene-aged Sevier River Formation.][[0.0]]
[The Boat Mesa is made mostly of conglomerates with minor amounts of sandstone and some limestone from lakes, representing stream and overbank flood deposits.][[0.0]]
[The brownish-gray sandstone and gravels of the Sevier River Formation were laid down in valleys that were part of the ancestral Sevier River drainage system.][[0.0]]
[Around 15�mya in Miocene time, tensional forces in Nevada to the west were so great that the crust was spread thin, creating the Basin and Range Province.][[0.0]]
[These same forces segmented what is now the western part of the Colorado Plateau into nine different smaller plateaus, including the Paunsaugunt that the park sits astride.][[0.0]]
[Long, north--south-trending normal faults were either newly created or reactivated from older pre-existing faults; a plateau rose on one side of each fault while valleys subsided on the other as the crust was extended in an east-west direction.][[0.0]]
[Two of these faults bound the Paunsaugunt Plateau; the Sevier on the west and the Paunsaugunt on the east.][[0.0]]
[Movement along these two faults has displaced the Claron Formation by 2,000�feet -LRB-600�m-RRB- relative to the Paria and Sevier valleys.][[0.0]]
[The Hurricane Fault marks the west edge of the Markagunt Plateau and is the topographic boundary between the Basin and Range and the Colorado Plateaus provinces.][[0.0]]
[Cedar Breaks National Monument, which shares almost the same exposed geology and erosional features as Bryce Canyon National Park, sits on the west edge of the Markagunt.][[0.0]]
[The entire Colorado Plateau then started to uplift from near sea level to several thousand feet -LRB-over a kilometer-RRB- in elevation.][[1.0]]
[An alternate theory is that the Laramide orogeny uplifted what is today the Basin and Range and the Colorado Plateau and that the tensional forces that formed the Basin and Range caused that region to subside relative to the Colorado Plateau.][[0.0]]
[Whatever the order of events were, the High Plateaus region of the Colorado Plateau were by now nearly complete.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Modern drainage and erosion Drainage of the Colorado Plateau was significantly altered by the opening of the Gulf of California.][[1.0]]
[Rifting tore Baja California Peninsula northwestward from the Mexican mainland starting some 10 to 5�mya.][[0.0]]
[The ancestral Colorado River responded to the regional downwarping by taking a shortcut to the sea by flowing into the new gulf.][[0.0]]
[This significantly decreased the distance from the river's headwaters and its delta at the sea.][[0.0]]
[Water in the Colorado and its tributaries moved faster as a result and cut down deeper, creating the canyonland topography.][[0.0]]
[Formation of approximately the current depth of the Colorado River's Grand Canyon by 1.2 mya further caused its tributaries to cut down even deeper.][[0.0]]
[Headward erosion of one of those tributaries, the Paria River, eroded north-northwestward toward what is now Paria Amphitheater.][[0.0]]
[The river took a route roughly parallel to and east of the Paunsaugunt Fault.][[0.0]]
[Erosion from snow and rain that fall directly on the east-facing rim of the Paunsaugunt Plateau forms gullies that widen into alcoves and amphitheaters while differential erosion and frost wedging create the hoodoos.][[0.0]]
[Streams on the plateau do not contribute to the formation of alcoves or amphitheaters because they flow away from the rim.][[0.0]]
[Erosion continues in this fashion today.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Hoodoo formation in Bryce Canyon The Pink Member of the Claron Formation is largely composed of easily eroded and relatively soft limestone.][[0.0]]
[When rain combines with carbon dioxide it forms a weak solution of carbonic acid.][[0.0]]
[This acid helps to slowly dissolve the limestone in the Claron Formation grain by grain.][[0.0]]
[It is this process of chemical weathering that rounds the edges of hoodoos and gives them their lumpy and bulging profiles.][[0.0]]
[In the winter, melting snow seeps into cracks and joints and freezes at night.][[0.0]]
[The force of the expanding ice helps to erode the rock of the Claron Formation.][[0.0]]
[Over 200 of these freeze/thaw cycles occur each year in Bryce Canyon.][[0.0]]
[Frost wedging exploits and widens the nearly vertical joint planes that divide the Pink Member of the Claron Formation.][[0.0]]
[Internal layers of mudstone, conglomerate and siltstone interrupt the limestone horizontally.][[0.0]]
[These layers are more resistant to attack by carbonic acid and they can therefore act as protective capstones of fins, windows and hoodoos.][[0.0]]
[Many of the more durable hoodoos are capped with a type of magnesium-rich limestone called dolomite.][[0.0]]
[Dolomite dissolves at a much slower rate, and consequently protects the weaker limestone underneath.][[0.0]]
[However, the same processes that create hoodoos will also eventually destroy them.][[0.0]]
[In the case of Bryce Canyon, the hoodoos' rate of erosion is 2--4�feet -LRB-0.6--1.3�m-RRB- every 100 years.][[0.0]]
[As the canyon continues to erode to the west it will eventually capture -LRB-in perhaps 3 million years-RRB- the watershed of the East Fork of the Sevier River.][[0.0]]
[Once this river flows through Bryce Amphitheater it will dominate the erosional pattern; replacing hoodoos with a V-shaped canyon and steep cliff walls typical of the weathering and erosional patterns created by rivers.][[0.0]]
[A foreshadowing of this can be observed in Water Canyon while hiking the Mossy Cave Trail.][[1.0]]
[A diversion canal has been taking a portion of the East Fork of the Sevier River through this section of the park for over 100 years.][[1.0]]

[Research is being undertaken into converting rapeseed oil into biodiesel, and the European biofuels directive intends to ensure that 5.75% Europe's transport fuel comes from renewable sources by 2010.][[0.0]]
[However, there is only enough used vegetable oil in the UK to contribute 0.38% of current road fuel demand and if all the arable land in the UK were turned over to biofuel crops this would still only satisfy 22% of the existing requirement for road transport.][[0.0]]
[Serious concerns regarding the ethics of growing biodiesel in developing countries and importing the fuel to Europe have been raised on the grounds that they may replace much needed food crops.][[0.0]]
[Converting any mainstream transport system to a renewable one also involves the conundrum that for consumers to use it the infrastructure must be in place, but high levels of use may be required to finance the infrastructure.][[0.0]]
[Developments are thus slow at present and renewably powered vehicles very much the exception.][[0.0]]
[Due to the relatively short growing season for sugar producing crops, ethanol is not commercially produced as a fuel in Scotland at present.][[0.0]]
[However there are encouraging developments in cellulosic decomposition that might enable grass or tree crops to be used to this end in future and which may prove to have lower net carbon emissions than other production techniques.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Biogas, anaerobic digestion and landfill gas Biogas, or landfill gas, is a biofuel produced through the intermediary stage of anaerobic digestion consisting mainly of 45--90% biologically produced methane and carbon dioxide.][[0.0]]
[In early 2007 a thermophilic anaerobic digestion facility was commissioned in Stornoway in the Western Isles.][[0.0]]
[The Scottish Environment Protection Agency -LRB-SEPA-RRB- and the Renewable Energy Association are also leading the way towards the establishment of a digestate standard to facilitate the use of solid outputs from digesters on land.][[0.0]]
[Anaerobic digestion and mechanical biological treatment facilities have been planned at a number of other locations in Scotland, such as Westray.][[0.0]]
[It has been recognised that biogas -LRB-mainly methane-RRB- -- produced from the anaerobic digestion of organic matter -- is potentially a valuable and prolific feedstock.][[0.0]]
[It is estimated that 0.4 GW of generating capacity might be available from agricultural waste in Scotland.][[0.0]]
[The Scottish Executive and SEPA has funded seven small scale farm trial plants with the British anaerobic digestion company Greenfinch in Southwest Scotland.][[0.0]]
[Landfill sites have the potential for a further 0.07 GW with sites such as the Avondale Landfill in Falkirk already utilising their potential.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Solid biomass Wood fuel almost certainly exceeds hydroelectric and wind as the largest source of renewable energy at present.][[0.0]]
[Scotland's forests, which currently make up 60% of the UK resource base, could provide up to 1 million tonnes of wood fuel per annum.][[0.0]]
[The biomass energy supply in Scotland could reach 450 MW or higher in coming years, -LRB-predominantly from wood-RRB-, with power stations requiring 4,500--5,000 oven dry tonnes per annum per megawatt of generating capacity.][[0.0]]

[There is growing demand for automatic wood pellet boilers which can be as convenient to use as conventional central heating systems, and which may be cheaper to run as well as being carbon neutral.][[0.0]]
[There is also local potential for energy crops such as short-rotation willow or poplar coppice, miscanthus energy grass, agricultural wastes such as straw and manure, and forestry residues.][[1.0]]
[These crops could provide 0.8 GW of generating capacity.][[0.0]]

[-LSB-edit-RSB- Solar energy Despite Scotland's relatively low level of sunshine hours, solar thermal panels can work effectively as they are capable of producing hot water even in cloudy weather.][[0.0]]
[The technology was developed in the 1970s and is well-established with various installers in place such as Solar Power Scotland of Montrose, although AES Solar based in Forres -LRB-who provided the panels for the Scottish Parliament building-RRB- are Scotland's only manufacturer.][[0.0]]
[There are few examples of photovoltaic panels, which generate electricity, in Scotland as the price is not currently competitive.][[0.0]]
[The introduction of Feed-In Tariffs in April 2010 will shorten the payback period on the cost of a PV installation, making solar PV a competitive form of renewable generation.][[0.0]]
[The largest installation in Scotland is a 21 kWp system at the Sir E. Scott secondary school in Tarbert, Harris.][[0.0]]
[The UK's practicable resource is estimated at 7.2 TWh per annum, which in the Scottish context is the approximate equivalent of 70 MW or less of installed capacity.][[1.0]]
[The ``road energy system'' uses water pipes buried beneath a layer of tarmac.][[0.0]]
[In the summer, the dark asphalt is heated by the sun which in turn heats the water in the pipes.][[0.0]]
[This water can be stored in an underground aquifer and the heat extracted in winter using a heat pump.][[0.0]]
[The system can be used to warm or cool down roads, keeping them ice-free and/or preventing softening due to overheating.][[0.0]]
[Alternatively, the stored energy can be used for cooling buildings.][[0.0]]
[The system was developed in the Netherlands and has been licensed by Ullapool-based Invisible Energy Systems, who have installed the technology in their car park.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Geothermal energy Geothermal energy is obtained by tapping the heat of the earth itself.][[0.0]]
[Most systems in Scotland provide heating through a ground source heat pump which brings energy to the surface via shallow pipe works.][[0.0]]
[An example is the Glenalmond Street project in Shettleston, which uses a combination of solar and geothermal energy to heat 16 houses.][[0.0]]
[Water in a coal mine 100�metres -LRB-328�ft-RRB- below ground level is heated by geothermal energy and maintained at a temperature of about 12 °C -LRB-54 °F-RRB- throughout the year.][[0.0]]
[The warmed water is raised and passed through a heat pump, boosting the temperature to 55�°C -LRB-131�°F-RRB-, and is then distributed to the houses providing heating to radiators.][[0.0]]
[Although the pumps may not be powered from renewable sources, up to four times the energy used can be recovered.][[0.0]]
[Installation costs can vary from £7,000 to £10,000, and grants may be available from the Scottish Community and Householders Renewables Initiative operated by Community Energy Scotland for domestic properties up to a maximum of £4,000.][[0.0]]
[Perhaps up to 7.6 TWh of energy is available on an annual basis from this source.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Other means of reducing carbon emissions It is clear that if carbon emissions are to be reduced, a combination of increased production from renewables and decreased consumption of energy in general and fossil fuels in particular will be required.][[0.0]]
[On the latter front, Gordon Brown, the then UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced in November 2006 that within a decade all new houses would have to be `zero carbon'.][[0.0]]
[A variety of other options exist, most of which may affect development of renewable technologies even if they are not means of producing energy from renewable sources themselves.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Other renewable options Various other ideas for renewable energy in the early stages of development, such as ocean thermal energy conversion, deep lake water cooling, and blue energy, have received little attention in Scotland, presumably because the potential is so significant for less speculative technologies.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Carbon offsetting Carbon offsetting involves individuals or organisations compensating for their use of fossil fuels by making payments to projects that aim to neutralise the effect of these carbon emissions.][[0.0]]
[Although the idea has become fashionable, the theory has received serious criticism of late.][[0.0]]
[Nonetheless, a credible option may be to plant trees within the local bioregion and maintain the forest on a permanent basis, thus locking up carbon produced by burning fossil fuels.][[0.0]]
[In British growing conditions this method can compensate for carbon at a rate of 200 tonnes per square kilometre -LRB-0.89�tons/acre-RRB- planted over a 100 year period.][[0.0]]
[Thus a 4-square-kilometre -LRB-988-acre-RRB- plantation could uptake 200 tonnes -LRB-220�tons-RRB- of carbon over twenty-five years.][[0.0]]
[This is the equivalent of 10,000 tonnes -LRB-11,000�short tons-RRB- of carbon dioxide.][[0.0]]
[The weaknesses of the approach include uncertainty as to whether the planting might have occurred anyway and who, in the future, will ensure permanence.][[0.0]]
[However, there is likely to be a greater level of credibility inherent in a nearby and visible scheme than in a far-distant one.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Challenges and opportunities offered by non-renewables The following technologies are means of reducing the effect of carbon emissions and form an important aspect of the energy debate in Scotland and are included here for completeness.][[0.0]]
[Their effect is likely to influence the future direction of commercial renewable energy, but they are not renewable forms of energy production themselves.][[0.0]]
[Carbon sequestration: Also known as carbon capture and storage, this technology involves the storage of carbon dioxide -LRB-CO2-RRB- that is a by-product of industrial processes through its injection into oil fields.][[0.0]]
[It is not a form of renewable energy production, but it may be a way to significantly reduce the effect of fossil fuels whilst renewables are commercialised.][[0.0]]
[It may also be an intermediate step towards a `hydrogen economy' -LRB-see below-RRB-, which could either enable further renewable development or conceivably out-compete it.][[0.0]]
[The technology has been successfully pioneered in Norway but is still a relatively untried concept.][[0.0]]
[`Clean coal' technology: It is has been estimated that it will be 2020 to 2025 before any commercial-scale clean coal power stations -LRB-coal-burning power stations with carbon capture and sequestration-RRB- are widely adopted.][[0.0]]
[Moreover, some have criticised the clean coal approach and it is at best a means of ameliorating carbon emissions.][[0.0]]
[It is not a form of renewable energy production, although like carbon sequestration it offers a significant commercial challenge to renewable developments.][[0.0]]
[In 2009 a licence to test underground coal gassification technology in Fife was granted to Thornton New Energy.][[0.0]]
[However, a plan to build a new ``clean coal'' power station at Hunterston collapsed in 2009 after financial backing was withdrawn.][[0.0]]
[Nuclear power: Renewable energy as a concept generally excludes nuclear power although this stance has been challenged.][[0.0]]
[Incineration: There is a successful waste-to-energy incineration plant at Lerwick in Shetland which burns 22,000 tonnes -LRB-24,250�tons-RRB- of waste every year and provides district heating to over 600 customers.][[0.0]]
[Although such plants generate carbon emissions through the combustion of the biological material and plastic wastes -LRB-which derive from fossil fuels-RRB-, they also reduce the damage done to the atmosphere from the creation of methane in landfill sites.][[0.0]]
[This is a much more damaging greenhouse gas than the carbon dioxide the burning process produces, although other systems which do not involve district heating may have a similar carbon footprint to straightforward landfill degradation.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Hydrogen Although hydrogen offers significant potential as an alternative to hydrocarbons as a carrier of energy, neither hydrogen itself nor the associated fuel cell technologies are sources of energy in themselves.][[0.0]]
[Nevertheless, the combination of renewable technologies and hydrogen is of considerable interest to those seeking alternatives to fossil fuels.][[0.0]]
[There are a number of Scottish projects involved in this research, supported by the Scottish Hydrogen & Fuel Cell Association -LRB-SHFCA-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[The PURE project on Unst in Shetland is a ground-breaking training and research centre which uses a combination of the ample supplies of wind power and fuel cells to create a wind hydrogen system.][[0.0]]
[Two 15�kW turbines are attached to a `Hypod' fuel cell, which in turn provides power for heating systems, the creation of stored liquid hydrogen and an innovative fuel-cell driven car.][[0.0]]
[The project is community-owned and part of the Unst Partnership, the community's development trust.][[0.0]]
[In the Western Isles a plan to enable a £10 million waste management plant into a hydrogen production facility was announced in June 2006.][[0.0]]

[In July 2008 the SHFCA announced plans for a ``hydrogen corridor'' from Aberdeen to Peterhead.][[0.0]]
[The proposal involves running hydrogen powered buses along the A 90 and is supported by Aberdeenshire Council and the Royal Mail.][[0.0]]
[The economics and practical application of hydrogen vehicles are currently being investigated by the University of Birmingham in England.][[0.0]]
[The ``Hydrogen Office'' in Methil aims to demonstrate the benefits of improved energy efficiency and renewable and hydrogen energy systems.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Local vs national concerns A significant feature of Scotland's renewable potential is that the resources are largely distant from the main centres of population.][[1.0]]
[This is by no means coincidental.][[0.0]]
[The power of wind, wave and tide on the north and west coasts and for hydro in the mountains makes for dramatic scenery, but sometimes harsh living conditions.][[0.0]]
[W. H. Murray described the Hebrides as ``the Isles on the Edge of the Sea where men are welcome--if they are hard in body and in spirit tenacious.''][[0.0]]
[This happenstance of geography and climate has created various tensions.][[0.0]]
[There is clearly a significant difference between a renewable energy production facility of modest size providing an island community with all its energy needs, and an industrial scale power station in the same location that is designed to export power to far distant urban locations.][[0.0]]
[Thus, plans for one of the world's largest onshore windfarms on the Hebridean island of Lewis, have generated considerable debate.][[0.0]]
[A related issue is the planned high-voltage Beauly--Denny power line which will bring electricity from renewable projects in the north and west to the cities of the south.][[0.0]]
[The matter went to a public inquiry and has been described by Ian Johnston of The Scotsman as a ``battle that pitches environmentalists against conservationists and giant energy companies against aristocratic landowners and clan chiefs''.][[0.0]]
[In January 2010 Jim Mather, the Energy Minister, announced that the project would be going ahead, notwithstanding the more than 18,000 objections received.][[0.0]]
[There is considerable support for community-scale energy projects.][[0.0]]
[For example, Alex Salmond, First Minister of Scotland, has stated that ``we can think big by delivering small'' and aspires to have a ``million Scottish households with access to their own or community renewable generation within ten years''.][[0.0]]
[The John Muir Trust has also stated that ``the best renewable energy options around wild land are small-scale, sensitively sited and adjacent to the communities directly benefiting from them'', although even community-owned schemes can prove controversial.][[0.0]]
[A related issue is the position of Scotland within the United Kingdom.][[0.0]]
[It has been alleged that UK transmission pricing structures are weighted against the development of renewables in Scotland, a debate which highlights the contrast between the sparsely populated north of Scotland and the highly urbanised south and east of England.][[0.0]]
[Although the ecological footprints of Scotland and England are similar the relationship between this footprint and the biocapacities of the respective countries are not.][[0.0]]
[Scotland's biocapacity -LRB-a measure of the biologically productive area-RRB- is 4.52 global hectares -LRB-gha-RRB- per head, some 15% less than the current ecological effect.][[0.0]]
[In other words, with a 15% reduction in consumption, the Scottish population could live within the productive capacity of the land to support them.][[0.0]]
[However, the UK ecological footprint is more than three times the biocapacity, which is only 1.6 gha head, amongst the lowest in Europe.][[0.0]]
[Thus, to achieve the same end in the UK context, consumption would have to be reduced by about 66%.][[0.0]]
[The developed world's economy is presently very dependent on inexpensive `point-source' fossil fuels.][[0.0]]
[Scotland, as a relatively sparsely populated country with significant renewable resources, is in a unique position to demonstrate how the transition to a low-carbon, widely distributed energy economy may be undertaken.][[0.0]]
[A balance will need to be struck between supporting this transition and providing exports to the economies of densely populated regions in the Central Belt and elsewhere, as they seek their own solutions.][[0.0]]
[The tension between local and national needs in the Scottish context may therefore also play out on the wider UK and European stage.][[0.0]]

[The former is an estimate of the maximum productive output of a given technology or individual generation station at a single point in time.][[0.0]]
[The latter takes into account the likely intermittency of energy supply and is a measure of output over a period of time.][[0.0]]
[Thus, for example, individual wind turbines may have a `capacity factor' of between 15% and 45% depending on their location, with a higher capacity factor giving a greater potential energy output for a given installed capacity.][[0.0]]
[The `potential energy' column is thus an estimate based on a variety of assumptions including the installed capacity.][[0.0]]
[Although `potential energy' is in some ways a more useful method of comparing the current output and future potential of different technologies, using it would require cumbersome explanations of all the assumptions involved in each example, so installed capacity figures are generally used.][[0.0]]

[-LSB-edit-RSB- Background The First Indochina War had raged, as guerrilla warfare, since 19 December 1946.][[0.0]]
[From 1949, it evolved into conventional warfare, due largely to aid from the People's Republic of China -LRB-``PRC''-RRB- to the north.][[0.0]]
[Subsequently, the French strategy of occupying small, poorly defended outposts throughout Indochina, particularly along the Vietnamese-Chinese border, was failing.][[0.0]]
[Thanks to the terrain and the close border with China, the Viet Minh had succeeded in turning a ``clandestine guerrilla movement into a powerful conventional army'', something which previously had never been encountered by the western world.][[0.0]]
[In October 1952, fighting around the Red River Delta spread into the Thai Highlands, resulting in the battle of Na San, at which the Viet Minh were defeated.][[0.0]]
[The French used the lessons learned at Na San -- strong ground bases, versatile air support, and a model based on the British Burma campaign -- as the basis for their new strategy.][[0.0]]
[The Viet Minh, however, remained unbeatable in the highland regions of Vietnam, and the French ``could not offset the fundamental disadvantages of a roadbound army facing a hill and forest army in a country which had few roads but a great many hills and forests''.][[0.0]]
[In May 1953, General Henri Navarre arrived to take command of the French forces, replacing General Raoul Salan.][[0.0]]
[Navarre spoke of a new offensive spirit in Indochina -- based on strong, fast-moving forces -- and the media quickly took Operation Camargue to be the ``practical realization'' of that.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Chinese and American backing Following the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War in 1949, the Viet Minh established close ties with China.][[0.0]]
[It enabled the Chinese to expand their area of influence into Indochina and the Viet Minh to receive much needed Chinese matériel and strategical planning support.][[0.0]]
[From mid-1950, PRC military advisers were seconded to the Viet Minh at battalion, regiment and divisional level.][[0.0]]
[The common border meant that ``China became a `sanctuary' where the Viet Minh could be trained and refitted''.][[0.0]]
[When the Korean War broke out, Indochina became ``an important pawn in cold war strategy''.][[0.0]]
[In December 1950, the United States, concerned about growing Chinese Communist influence, started providing military aid to the French, with a first payment of US$15 million.][[0.0]]
[In the spring of 1953, the Viet Minh launched campaigns in Laos and succeeded in linking up Laotian territorial gains with their bases in north-western Vietnam.][[0.0]]
[Meanwhile, the winding down of the Korean War meant that China was able ``to give much more attention to its southern neighbour''.][[0.0]]
[Similarly, the US ``released from its heavy burden in the Korean conflict ... dramatically increased its military and financial support'' to the French.][[0.0]]
[By June 1953, the US ``had sent: 1,224 tanks and combat vehicles; 120,792 rifles and machine guns; more than 200 million rifle and machine gun cartridges; more than five million artillery projectiles; 302 boats and 304 aircraft'' -LRB-by end of the war, total US aid would amount to nearly four billion dollars-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Prelude to the battle Route One, also known as Route Coloniale One -LRB-or RC1-RRB-, had been the main north--south artery along the coastline of North Vietnam since the outbreak of violence in 1949.][[0.0]]
[Communications and convoys along these lines suffered from regular attacks by Viet Minh irregulars, despite efforts by the French during 1952 in Operation Sauterelle.][[0.0]]
[The Viet Minh paramilitary forces around Road One originated mainly from a region of fortified villages dispersed along sand dunes and salt marshes between Hué to the south, and Quang-Tri to the north.][[0.0]]
[French forces had suffered from Viet Minh ambushes, an attack that the latter had become very proficient at throughout the war, most notably in the annihilation of Group Mobiles 42 and 100.][[0.0]]
[The roads in Vietnam were almost all closed during the night and ``abandoned to the enemy''.][[0.0]]
[Between 1952 and 1954, 398 armored vehicles were destroyed, 84% of them from mines and booby traps.][[0.0]]
[Typically, the Viet Minh ambushed convoys by obstructing the road with a fallen tree or pile of boulders, and then destroying the first and last vehicles of the halted convey with remote mines.][[0.0]]
[Caltraps, mines and the steep cliff faces naturally found at the road side aided in funneling the target convoy into a small area, where machine guns, mortars and recoilless rifles were trained.][[0.0]]
[Viet Minh Regiment 95 repeatedly deployed these tactics, inflicting severe losses on the French forces passing along Road One, which led to its French nickname of la rue sans joie -LRB-``the street without joy''-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Regiment 95 was, along with Regiments 18 and 101, part of the Viet Minh Division 325, commanded by General Tran Quy Ha.][[0.0]]
[The division was formed in 1951 from pre-existing units in Thua Thien just north of Road One, and became operational in the summer of 1952.][[0.0]]
[By early summer 1953, thanks in part to the wind-down of hostilities in the Korean War, the French command had ``sufficient reserves'' at hand to begin clearing the Viet Minh back from Road One.][[1.0]]
[They assembled 30 battalions, two armored regiments and two artillery regiments for one of the largest operations of the conflict.][[0.0]]
[Called Operation Camargue, it was named for the sandy marshland to the west of Marseilles, France.][[0.0]]
[The difficult terrain was to prove the decisive factor and gave a major advantage to the one Viet Minh regiment tasked with defending the Street Without Joy.][[1.0]]
[From a 100-meter -LRB-109�yd-RRB- deep beach of ``hard sand'' the French landing forces were to advance through a series of dunes.][[0.0]]
[The dunes were up to 20�meters -LRB-22�yd-RRB- high and interspersed with precipices, ditches and a handful of small villages.][[0.0]]
[Beyond this was an 800-meter -LRB-875�yd-RRB- belt of pagodas and temples, which war correspondent Bernard Fall describes as having excellent defensive potential.][[0.0]]
[Beyond these temples was Road One itself with a series of closely packed and fortified villages, including Tan An, My Thuy, Van Trinh and Lai-Ha.][[0.0]]

[-LSB-edit-RSB- French order of battle The French divided their forces into four Groupement mobiles -LRB-``mobile groups''-RRB-: A through D. Group A consisted of Mobile Group 14, which contained 3rd Amphibious Group, 2nd Marine Commando, 2nd Battalion 1st Colonial Parachute Regiment, and 3rd Vietnamese Parachute Battalion.][[0.0]]
[Operation Camargue was to be one of the final proving grounds for the use of French armor during the war.][[0.0]]
[It was to land on the beach in line with the center of Road One.][[0.0]]
[Meanwhile, Group B was to advance over land from the west of the north-east facing beach.][[0.0]]
[This group consisted of Mobile Group Central Vietnam's 6th Moroccan Spahis, 2nd Amphibious Group, a tank platoon from 1st Foreign Cavalry Regiment, and two infantry companies from the Quang-Tri military base.][[0.0]]
[Group C was to advance from the south-west into the back of Van Trinh through the swamps, and consisted of the 9th Moroccan Tabor, 27th Vietnamese Infantry Battalion, 2nd Battalion of the 4th Moroccan Rifle Regiment, 1 Commando, a tank platoon of the Moroccan Colonials, an Armored Patrol Boat Platoon, and an LCM Platoon.][[0.0]]
[Group D consisted of 3rd Battalion of the 3rd Algerian Rifles, the 7th Amphibious Group, and a Commando group, and was to land at the south-east end of the beach, below Group A.][[0.0]]
[These forces in total formed ``two amphibious forces, three land-borne groupments and one airborne force'' all of which was commanded by General Leblanc.][[0.0]]
[This French force, vastly outnumbering the Viet Minh regiment opposing it, was tasked with sealing the Communist forces into a tight pocket, and systematically destroying them, as well as capturing as many prisoners, arms caches and as much equipment as possible.][[1.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Securing the Street Without Joy -LSB-edit-RSB- French landing On 27 July 1953, the French landing craft departed from their assembly points, and by 04:00 on the following had begun disembarking 160 amphibious landing craft belonging to Group A's 3rd Amphibious opposite the coastline.][[0.0]]
[By 06:00, these vehicles had landed on the beach and proceeded to occupy sand ridges overlooking the dunes beyond.][[0.0]]
[Proceeding into the dunes, the vehicles of 3rd Amphibious became stuck in the sand; in the meantime, other regular infantry elements of Group A were experiencing more difficulties in the sea, taking two extra hours to reach the beach.][[0.0]]
[Thus unsupported, elements of 3rd Amphibious that either disembarked floundering vehicles or were pushed, managed to escape the dunes and advance between Tan An and My Thuy.][[0.0]]
[The French amphibious vehicles were the World War II-era 29-C cargo carriers, nicknamed the Crab or Crabe and LVT 4 or 4As, known as the Alligator.][[0.0]]
[The latter was armed with two .30 caliber and two .50 caliber Browning machine guns and an M20 recoilless rifle.][[0.0]]
[While the Alligators were heavily armored and well suited to the water, they struggled on land.][[0.0]]
[In contrast, the Crab had difficulty in water and its large size presented too great a target on land; however, it was lighter and more maneuverable, except in paddy fields where its suspension became clogged with vegetation.][[0.0]]
[While Group A's forward elements were breaching the dune barrier unopposed, two of Group B's battalions crossed the Van Trinh Canal.][[0.0]]
[By 07:45, when they made visual contact with the Crabs and Alligators of Group A, they had succeeded in sealing off the northern escape route of Regiment 95.][[0.0]]
[By 08:30, the 6th Moroccan Spahis also reached the canal, having had difficulty crossing the swamps on the landward side with their M24 Chaffee tanks.][[0.0]]
[No French units, as yet, had made any major contact with the Viet Minh.][[0.0]]
[A minor fire-fight had taken place on the southern edge of Group B's advance when an Algerian company exchanged fire with 20--30 Viet Minh and suffered the first French fatalities.][[0.0]]
[Simultaneously, Group C had advanced into the center of the area of operation, and executed ``the most complicated maneuver of the operation''.][[0.0]]
[This involved crossing Road One and sealing off the land side of the operational area, and was completed by 08:30.][[0.0]]
[Group D, finally, was tasked with advancing south from its landing point to close off an escape route that ran between the sea and an inland lagoon towards the city of Hué.][[0.0]]
[Landing at 04:30, the group made quick progress through the beach and dunes, secured the small city of Thé Chi Dong and hit the north coast of the lagoon by 05:30, thereby sealing off that escape route with no enemy contact.][[0.0]]
[The final act of sealing the noose was to move some of the French Navy vessels north to the Vietnamese villages of Ba-Lang and An-Hoi where any attempt by Regiment 95 to flee by sea would have taken place.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Tightening the loop With the landings and the encirclement of Regiment 95 complete and the net deemed secure, the French forces began the second phase of the operation and began to sweep through the area for the encircled Viet Minh.][[1.0]]
[Each French group began to move through the villages around Road One in an attempt to locate the Viet Minh forces.][[0.0]]
[Group B, which was lined up along the canal -- the jump-off point for the second phase of the operation -- moved to sweep the northern villages while Group C did the same further south.][[0.0]]
[The method of searching each village was to seal it off entirely with encircling troops, and then inspect it with a heavily armed unit of minesweepers and K-9 teams.][[0.0]]
[Men of military age were arrested and screened by intelligence officers.][[0.0]]
[This process was time-consuming, and by 11:00 Group B had traveled 7�kilometers -LRB-4.3�mi-RRB- through the network of villages with no results or resistance.][[0.0]]
[At this time, the 6th Moroccan Spahis entered the village of Dong-Qué with their M-24 tanks and the support of the 1st Battalion of the Moroccan Rifles and the artillery of Colonel Piroth -LRB-later commander of the artillery at the battle of Dien Bien Phu-RRB- and his 69th African Artillery Regiment.][[0.0]]
[The Moroccan infantry took the lead, and the French commanders sealed themselves in their tank turrets and advanced behind.][[0.0]]
[Viet Minh forces, which were waiting in ambush, fired almost the same instant as the lead Moroccan units who noticed their presence.][[0.0]]
[The Moroccan forces spread out into the surrounding rice paddies, and the bazookas of the Viet Minh missed the French tanks.][[0.0]]
[The French commander called in Piroth's artillery and Dong-Qué ``disintegrated under the impact of their high-angle fire'', particularly when a French shell found the Viet Minh ammunition depot.][[0.0]]
[As the French tanks approached, the Viet Minh drove the civilians out to clog up the entrance to the village, however as the Viet Minh retreated they were spotted through the civilians by the Moroccan infantry and killed by 13:00.][[0.0]]
[During this battle, however, most of the Regiment 95 personnel who had been elsewhere managed to escape towards the southern end of the French encirclement.][[0.0]]
[Leblanc had realized the intentions of Regiment 95's commander, and had requested one of the two reserve paratroop units to be deployed at the border between the network of temples and the dune-filled area in front of where Group D had originally landed.][[0.0]]
[This paratroop unit, 2nd Battalion of the 1st Colonial Parachute Regiment, began to advance towards the canal at 10:45, 15 minutes before Group B entered Dong-Qué.][[0.0]]
[Group C's 9th Tabor had also, like the M-24's of Group B, struggled through the marshes during the first phase of the operation, and were late in arriving at the jumping-off point for phase two, the canal.][[0.0]]
[At 08:45, Moroccan units of Group C were investigating the village of Phu-An on the opposite side of the lagoon from Group D's landing area, when they came under heavy fire.][[0.0]]
[Despite being nearer to Group D, the engaged units radioed their immediate commanders back in Group C, who were by now some distance away, further inland.][[0.0]]
[This delay, coupled with the failure of many of the units SCR300 radios, meant that these advance elements of Group C failed to get through until 09:10.][[0.0]]
[At 09:40, the commander of Group C called up various reinforcements from Hué including two companies of Vietnamese trainee NCOs and five infantry companies, two of which came via landing craft and did not reach the beleaguered elements of Group C until 18:00, half an hour after the Moroccans had finally counter-attacked and occupied Phu-An.][[0.0]]
[The 2nd Battalion of the Parachute Chasseurs Regiment had been requested to drop at 14:00 to support the advanced elements of Group C but did not jump until 16:50 and thus failed to assemble before the Moroccans themselves occupied Phu-An.][[0.0]]
[With the final capture of Phu-An, the extreme southern tip of the encirclement, the pincer movement was complete.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Escape of Regiment 95 By 17:30, with Phu-An captured, all French reserves now committed, and one half of the pocket fully swept by Groups B and A at the northern end of the battlefield, the French appeared to have gained the upper hand.][[0.0]]
[By now, the expected windfall of arms caches and prisoners should have taken place.][[0.0]]
[However, the unexpected time taken to capture Phu-An, and the delayed arrival of the paratroop reinforcements who had been scattered by the winds, had left a gap between Phu-An and the southern edge of the lagoon.][[0.0]]
[This 12-kilometer -LRB-7.5�mi-RRB- gap was eventually covered by only four French battalions, leaving gaps through which the Viet Minh could escape.][[0.0]]
[Crabs and Alligators were stationed on, or in some cases in, the canal network, and French infantry were scattered across the edge of the pocket throughout that night in order to detect escaping Viet Minh.][[0.0]]
[However, despite the occasional shot, flare and searchlight, no Viet Minh were detected.][[0.0]]
[On the morning of 29 July 1953, the French forces continued to advance into the remaining 23-square-kilometer -LRB-9�sq�mi-RRB- pocket, encountering neither Viet Minh nor civilian.][[0.0]]
[Groups A, B and D reached the edge of the canal opposite Group C by 13:00, having retrieved a small number of suspected Viet Minh and a ``few weapons''.][[0.0]]
[At this time, however, a Morane aircraft detected the movement of elements of Regiment 95 towards An-Hoi on the extreme northern corner of the operational area, outside of the pocket.][[0.0]]
[The French carried out a raid on An-Hoi by commando groups and elements of Group A, which took place at 15:00 and returned with suspected Viet Minh by 18:00.][[1.0]]
[The French then undertook a methodical house-to-house search of the entire area, sweeping each village, and the surrounding paddy fields and jungle, risking encounter with Viet Minh caltrops.][[0.0]]
[Meanwhile, 2nd and 3rd Amphibious used their Crabs and Alligators to herd prisoners towards Trung-An for interrogation.][[0.0]]

[-LSB-edit-RSB- Aftermath -LSB-edit-RSB- Rebuilding and reaction After the departure of all but regular French infantry, efforts to make the area suitable for permanent occupation by French forces and French-friendly civilians began.][[0.0]]
[This involved the rebuilding of road and rail links -LRB-a rail line ran alongside Road One-RRB-, the repairing of infrastructure, demining, the installation of new Vietnamese government administrators, and the provision of ``everything from rice to anti-malaria tablets''.][[0.0]]
[Over 24 villages were placed under the authority of the Vietnamese government, and Regiment 95 had been driven from the area.][[0.0]]
[In comparison to Fall, South Vietnamese general Lam Quang Thi states in his memoirs that Operation Camargue was ``one of the most successful French military operations during the Indochina war'' in the area of Road One.][[1.0]]
[Newspapers stated that the operation had been a ``total success, demonstrating once more the new aggressiveness and mobility'' of the French forces.][[0.0]]
[However, in the days following the end of the fighting, press reports on the French failure to capture the anticipated large numbers of Viet Minh began to appear though the British newspaper, The Times, did publish claimed casualty figures of 1,550 for the Viet Minh, 200 of which killed.][[0.0]]
[This estimate was altered by the French the next day to 600 killed or wounded and 900 captured, and it was suggested that the operation did ``not appear to have been successful''.][[0.0]]
[In contrast to these figures, Bernard Fall records 182 Viet Minh casualties and 387 prisoners.][[0.0]]
[He also notes that ``51 rifles, eight sub-machine guns, two mortars, and five BARs'' were captured.][[0.0]]
[Of the prisoners, however, it is not recorded how many were confirmed to be members of Regiment 95.][[0.0]]
[Both Fall and the newspapers published in the days following the official termination of the operation on 10 August 1953, give French casualties as 17 dead and 100 wounded.][[0.0]]
[Giap wrote ``it was announced we suffered heavy losses although in fact our losses were insignificant ... their troops had to withdraw with heavy losses''.][[0.0]]
[Fall goes on to record that the ``major defect'' of Operation Camargue was that the French had nothing like the numerical superiority to encircle a force in the terrain around Road One, 15:1 as opposed to the 20:1 or 25:1 that he believed required.][[0.0]]
[He states that the slow French progress -LRB-around 1,500 yards an hour-RRB- and the large distances each unit had to guard from Viet Minh infiltration meant that the Viet Minh could easily escape the net.][[1.0]]
[He also states that Viet Minh intelligence were always aware of French movements, as the size of French units and the complex technology involved in the operation gave its presence and intentions away almost immediately, whereas in contrast the simpler Viet Minh operations were far more difficult to detect.][[1.0]]

[-LSB-edit-RSB- Characteristics Heavy metal is traditionally characterized by loud distorted guitars, emphatic rhythms, dense bass-and-drum sound, and vigorous vocals.][[1.0]]
[Metal subgenres variously emphasize, alter, or omit one or more of these attributes.][[0.0]]
[New York Times critic Jon Pareles writes, ``In the taxonomy of popular music, heavy metal is a major subspecies of hard-rock--the breed with less syncopation, less blues, more showmanship and more brute force.''][[0.0]]
[The typical band lineup includes a drummer, a bassist, a rhythm guitarist, a lead guitarist, and a singer, who may or may not be an instrumentalist.][[0.0]]
[Keyboard instruments are sometimes used to enhance the fullness of the sound.][[0.0]]
[The electric guitar and the sonic power that it projects through amplification has historically been the key element in heavy metal.][[0.0]]
[The lead role of the guitar in heavy metal often collides with the traditional ``frontman'' or bandleader role of the vocalist, creating a musical tension as the two ``contend for dominance'' in a spirit of ``affectionate rivalry''.][[0.0]]
[Heavy metal ``demands the subordination of the voice'' to the overall sound of the band.][[0.0]]
[Reflecting metal's roots in the 1960s counterculture, an ``explicit display of emotion'' is required from the vocals as a sign of authenticity.][[0.0]]
[Critic Simon Frith claims that the metal singer's ``tone of voice'' is more important than the lyrics.][[0.0]]
[Metal vocals vary widely in style, from the multioctave, theatrical approach of Judas Priest's Rob Halford and Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickinson, to the gruff style of Motörhead's Lemmy and Metallica's James Hetfield, to the growling of many death metal performers.][[0.0]]
[The prominent role of the bass is also key to the metal sound, and the interplay of bass and guitar is a central element.][[0.0]]
[The bass guitar provides the low-end sound crucial to making the music ``heavy''.][[0.0]]
[Metal basslines vary widely in complexity, from holding down a low pedal point as a foundation to doubling complex riffs and licks along with the lead and/or rhythm guitars.][[0.0]]
[Some bands feature the bass as a lead instrument, an approach popularized by Metallica's Cliff Burton in the early 1980s.][[0.0]]
[The essence of metal drumming is creating a loud, constant beat for the band using the ``trifecta of speed, power, and precision''.][[0.0]]
[Metal drumming ``requires an exceptional amount of endurance'', and drummers have to develop ``considerable speed, coordination, and dexterity...to play the intricate patterns'' used in metal.][[0.0]]
[A characteristic metal drumming technique is the cymbal choke, which consists of striking a cymbal and then immediately silencing it by grabbing it with the other hand -LRB-or, in some cases, the same striking hand-RRB-, producing a burst of sound.][[0.0]]
[The metal drum setup is generally much larger than those employed in other forms of rock music.][[0.0]]
[In live performance, loudness--an ``onslaught of sound,'' in sociologist Deena Weinstein's description--is considered vital.][[0.0]]
[In his book Metalheads, psychologist Jeffrey Arnett refers to heavy metal concerts as ``the sensory equivalent of war.''][[0.0]]
[Following the lead set by Jimi Hendrix, Cream and The Who, early heavy metal acts such as Blue Cheer set new benchmarks for volume.][[0.0]]
[As Blue Cheer's Dick Peterson put it, ``All we knew was we wanted more power.''][[0.0]]
[A 1977 review of a Motörhead concert noted how ``excessive volume in particular figured into the band's impact.''][[0.0]]
[Weinstein makes the case that in the same way that melody is the main element of pop and rhythm is the main focus of house music, powerful sound, timbre, and volume are the key elements of metal.][[0.0]]
[She argues that the loudness is designed to ``sweep the listener into the sound'' and to provide a ``shot of youthful vitality.''][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Musical language -LSB-edit-RSB- Rhythm and tempo The rhythm in metal songs is emphatic, with deliberate stresses.][[0.0]]
[Weinstein observes that the wide array of sonic effects available to metal drummers enables the ``rhythmic pattern to take on a complexity within its elemental drive and insistency.''][[0.0]]
[In many heavy metal songs, the main groove is characterized by short, two-note or three-note rhythmic figures--generally made up of 8th or 16th notes.][[0.0]]
[These rhythmic figures are usually performed with a staccato attack created by using a palm-muted technique on the rhythm guitar.][[0.0]]
[Brief, abrupt, and detached rhythmic cells are joined into rhythmic phrases with a distinctive, often jerky texture.][[0.0]]
[These phrases are used to create rhythmic accompaniment and melodic figures called riffs, which help to establish thematic hooks.][[0.0]]
[Heavy metal songs also use longer rhythmic figures such as whole note- or dotted quarter note-length chords in slow-tempo power ballads.][[0.0]]
[The tempos in early heavy metal music tended to be ``slow, even ponderous.''][[0.0]]
[By the late 1970s, however, metal bands were employing a wide variety of tempos.][[0.0]]
[In the 2000s, metal tempos range from slow ballad tempos -LRB-quarter note = 60 beats per minute-RRB- to extremely fast blast beat tempos -LRB-quarter note = 350 beats per minute-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Harmony One of the signatures of the genre is the guitar power chord.][[0.0]]
[In technical terms, the power chord is relatively simple: it involves just one main interval, generally the perfect fifth, though an octave may be added as a doubling of the root.][[0.0]]
[Although the perfect fifth interval is the most common basis for the power chord, power chords are also based on different intervals such as the minor third, major third, perfect fourth, diminished fifth, or minor sixth.][[0.0]]
[Most power chords are also played with a consistent finger arrangement that can be slid easily up and down the fretboard.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Typical harmonic structures Heavy metal is usually based on riffs created with three main harmonic traits: modal scale progressions, tritone and chromatic progressions, and the use of pedal points.][[0.0]]
[Traditional heavy metal tends to employ modal scales, in particular the Aeolian and Phrygian modes.][[0.0]]
[Harmonically speaking, this means the genre typically incorporates modal chord progressions such as the Aeolian progressions I-VI-VII, I-VII--LRB-VI-RRB-, or I-VI-IV-VII and Phrygian progressions implying the relation between I and ♭II -LRB-I-♭II-I, I-♭II-III, or I-♭II-VII for example-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Tense-sounding chromatic or tritone relationships are used in a number of metal chord progressions.][[0.0]]
[The tritone, an interval spanning three whole tones--such as C and F#--was a forbidden dissonance in medieval ecclesiastical singing, which led monks to call it diabolus in musica--``the devil in music.''][[0.0]]
[Because of that original symbolic association, it came to be heard in Western cultural convention as ``evil''.][[0.0]]
[Heavy metal has made extensive use of the tritone in guitar solos and riffs, such as in the beginning of ``Black Sabbath''.][[0.0]]
[Heavy metal songs often make extensive use of pedal point as a harmonic basis.][[0.0]]
[A pedal point is a sustained tone, typically in the bass range, during which at least one foreign -LRB-i.e., dissonant-RRB- harmony is sounded in the other parts.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Relationship with classical music Robert Walser argues that, alongside blues and R&B, the ``assemblage of disparate musical styles known...as `classical music''' has been a major influence on heavy metal since the genre's earliest days.][[0.0]]
[He claims that metal's ``most influential musicians have been guitar players who have also studied classical music.][[0.0]]
[Their appropriation and adaptation of classical models sparked the development of a new kind of guitar virtuosity -LSB-and-RSB- changes in the harmonic and melodic language of heavy metal.''][[0.0]]
[The Grove Music Online states that the ``1980s brought on ...the widespread adaptation of chord progressions and virtuosic practices from 18th-century European models, especially Bach and Vivaldi, by influential guitarists such as Van Halen, Randy Rhoads and Yngwie Malmsteen''.][[0.0]]
[Although a number of metal musicians cite classical composers as inspiration, classical and metal are rooted in different cultural traditions and practices--classical in the art music tradition, metal in the popular music tradition.][[0.0]]
[As musicologists Nicolas Cook and Nicola Dibben note, ``Analyses of popular music also sometimes reveal the influence of `art traditions.'][[0.0]]
[An example is Walser's linkage of heavy metal music with the ideologies and even some of the performance practices of nineteenth-century Romanticism.][[1.0]]
[However, it would be clearly wrong to claim that traditions such as blues, rock, heavy metal, rap or dance music derive primarily from `art music.'''][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Lyrical themes Black Sabbath and the many metal bands they inspired have concentrated lyrically ``on dark and depressing subject matter to an extent hitherto unprecedented in any form of pop music,'' according to scholars David Hatch and Stephen Millward.][[0.0]]
[They take as an example Sabbath's 1970 album Paranoid, which ``included songs dealing with personal trauma--`Paranoid' and `Fairies Wear Boots' -LRB-which described the unsavoury side effects of drug-taking-RRB---as well as those confronting wider issues, such as the self-explanatory `War Pigs' and `Hand of Doom.'''][[0.0]]
[Nuclear annihilation was addressed in later metal songs such as Iron Maiden's ``2 Minutes to Midnight'' and Ozzy Osbourne's ``Killer of Giants''.][[0.0]]
[Death is a predominant theme in heavy metal, routinely featuring in the lyrics of bands as otherwise widely different as Slayer and W.A.S.P..][[0.0]]
[The more extreme forms of death metal and grindcore tend to have aggressive and gory lyrics.][[0.0]]
[Deriving from the genre's roots in blues music, sex is another important topic--a thread running from Led Zeppelin's suggestive lyrics to the more explicit references of glam and nu metal bands.][[0.0]]
[Romantic tragedy is a standard theme of gothic and doom metal, as well as of nu metal, where teenage angst is another central topic.][[0.0]]
[Heavy metal songs often feature outlandish, fantasy-inspired lyrics, lending them an escapist quality.][[0.0]]
[Iron Maiden's songs, for instance, were frequently inspired by mythology, fiction, and poetry, such as Iron Maiden's ``Rime of the Ancient Mariner,'' based on the Samuel Taylor Coleridge poem.][[0.0]]
[Led Zeppelin lyrics often reference Lord of the Rings as well as other mythology and folklore, such as in the songs ``The Battle of Evermore'', ``Immigrant Song'', ``Ramble On'', ``No Quarter'', and ``Achilles Last Stand''.][[0.0]]
[Other examples include Black Sabbath's ``The Wizard,'' Megadeth's ``The Conjuring'' and ``Five Magics,'' and Judas Priest's ``Dreamer Deceiver''.][[0.0]]
[Since the 1980s, with the rise of thrash metal and songs such as Metallica's ''...And Justice for All'' and Megadeth's ``Peace Sells'', more metal lyrics have included sociopolitical commentary.][[0.0]]
[Genres such as melodic death metal, progressive metal, and black metal often explore philosophical themes.][[0.0]]
[The thematic content of heavy metal has long been a target of criticism.][[0.0]]
[According to Jon Pareles, ``Heavy metal's main subject matter is simple and virtually universal.][[0.0]]
[With grunts, moans and subliterary lyrics, it celebrates...a party without limits... -LSB-T-RSB-he bulk of the music is stylized and formulaic.''][[0.0]]

[-LSB-edit-RSB- Image and fashion As with much popular music, visual imagery plays a large role in heavy metal.][[0.0]]
[In addition to its sound and lyrics, a heavy metal band's ``image'' is expressed in album sleeve art, logos, stage sets, clothing, and music videos.][[0.0]]
[Some heavy metal acts such as Alice Cooper, Kiss, and Gwar have become known as much for their outrageous performance personas and stage shows as for their music.][[0.0]]
[Down-the-back long hair, according to Weinstein, is the ``most crucial distinguishing feature of metal fashion.''][[0.0]]
[Originally adopted from the hippie subculture, by the 1980s and 1990s heavy metal hair ``symbolised the hate, angst and disenchantment of a generation that seemingly never felt at home,'' according to journalist Nader Rahman.][[0.0]]
[Long hair gave members of the metal community ``the power they needed to rebel against nothing in general.''][[0.0]]

[-LSB-edit-RSB- Background to the migration The Latter Day Saints were first organized as the Church of Christ in 1830.][[0.0]]
[Early members of the Church often encountered hostility, primarily due to their practice of withdrawing from secular society and gathering in locales to practice their distinct religious beliefs.][[0.0]]
[Their neighbors felt threatened by the Church's rapid growth in numbers, by its tendency to vote as a bloc and acquire political power, by its claims of divine favor, and by the practice of polygamy.][[0.0]]
[Violence directed against the Church and its members caused the body of the Church to move from Ohio to Missouri, then to Illinois.][[0.0]]

[While Lego Star Wars followed the events of The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith, Lego Star Wars II is based on A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.][[1.0]]
[The game comically retells the trilogy's events using cut scenes without dialogue.][[0.0]]
[The player assumes the roles of the films' characters, each of which possess specific weapons and abilities.][[0.0]]
[At any time, a second player can join the game by activating a second controller.][[0.0]]

[The game's central location is the Mos Eisley Cantina, a spaceport bar on the planet Tatooine.][[0.0]]
[At the counter, the player may use their Lego studs to purchase characters, vehicles, gameplay hints and extras, or activate cheat codes.][[0.0]]
[In a small area outside the cantina, players may view collected vehicles.][[0.0]]

[The first suggestion of a database of journal paper abstracts was made at a conference on Astronomy from Large Data-bases held in Garching bei München in 1987.][[0.0]]
[Initial development of an electronic system for accessing astrophysical abstracts took place during the following two years; in 1991 discussions took place on how to integrate ADS with the SIMBAD database, containing all available catalog designations for objects outside the solar system, to create a system where astronomers could search for all the papers written about a given object.][[0.0]]
[An initial version of ADS, with a database consisting of 40 papers, was created as a proof of concept in 1988, and the ADS database was successfully connected with the SIMBAD database in the summer of 1993.][[0.0]]
[The creators believed this was the first use of the Internet to allow simultaneous querying of transatlantic scientific databases.][[0.0]]
[Until 1994, the service was available via proprietary network software, but it was transferred to the nascent World Wide Web early that year.][[0.0]]
[The number of users of the service quadrupled in the five weeks following the introduction of the ADS web-based service.][[0.0]]
[At first, the journal articles available via ADS were scanned bitmaps created from the paper journals, but from 1995 onwards, the Astrophysical Journal began to publish an on-line edition, soon followed by the other main journals such as Astronomy and Astrophysics and the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.][[1.0]]
[ADS provided links to these electronic editions from their first appearance.][[0.0]]
[Since about 1995, the number of ADS users has doubled roughly every two years.][[0.0]]
[ADS now has agreements with almost all astronomical journals, who supply abstracts.][[0.0]]
[Scanned articles from as far back as the early 19th century are available via the service, which now contains over eight million documents.][[0.0]]
[The service is distributed worldwide, with twelve mirror sites in twelve countries on five continents, with the database synchronized by means of weekly updates using rsync, a mirroring utility which allows updates to only the portions of the database which have changed.][[0.0]]
[All updates are triggered centrally, but they initiate scripts at the mirror sites which ``pull'' updated data from the main ADS servers.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Data in the system Papers are indexed within the database by their bibliographic record, containing the details of the journal they were published in and various associated metadata, such as author lists, references and citations.][[0.0]]
[Originally this data was stored in ASCII format, but eventually the limitations of this encouraged the database maintainers to migrate all records to an XML -LRB-Extensible Markup Language-RRB- format in 2000.][[0.0]]
[Bibliographic records are now stored as an XML element, with sub-elements for the various metadata.][[0.0]]
[Since the advent of online editions of journals, abstracts are loaded into the ADS on or before the publication date of articles, with the full journal text available to subscribers.][[1.0]]
[Older articles have been scanned, and an abstract is created using optical character recognition software.][[0.0]]
[Scanned articles from before about 1995 are usually available free, by agreement with the journal publishers.][[0.0]]
[Scanned articles are stored in TIFF format, at both medium and high resolution.][[0.0]]
[The TIFF files are converted on demand into GIF files for on-screen viewing, and PDF or PostScript files for printing.][[0.0]]
[The generated files are then cached to eliminate needlessly frequent regenerations for popular articles.][[0.0]]
[As of 2000, ADS contained 250 GB of scans, which consisted of 1,128,955 article pages comprising 138,789 articles.][[0.0]]
[By 2005 this had grown to 650 GB, and is expected to grow further, to about 900 GB by 2007.][[0.0]]
[No further information has been published.][[0.0]]
[The database initially contained only astronomical references, but has now grown to incorporate three databases, covering astronomy -LRB-including planetary sciences and solar physics-RRB- references, physics -LRB-including instrumentation and geosciences-RRB- references, as well as preprints of scientific papers from arXiv.][[1.0]]
[The astronomy database is by far the most advanced and its use accounts for about 85% of the total ADS usage.][[0.0]]
[Articles are assigned to the different databases according to the subject rather than the journal they are published in, so that articles from any one journal might appear in all three subject databases.][[0.0]]
[The separation of the databases allows searching in each discipline to be tailored, so that words can automatically be given different weight functions in different database searches, depending on how common they are in the relevant field.][[0.0]]
[Data in the preprint archive is updated daily from the arXiv, the main repository of physics and astronomy preprints.][[0.0]]
[The advent of preprint servers has, like ADS, had a significant impact on the rate of astronomical research, as papers are often made available from preprint servers weeks or months before they are published in the journals.][[0.0]]
[The incorporation of preprints from the arXiv into ADS means that the search engine can return the most current research available, with the caveat that preprints may not have been peer reviewed or proofread to the required standard for publication in the main journals.][[0.0]]
[ADS's database links preprints with subsequently published articles wherever possible, so that citation and reference searches will return links to the journal article where the preprint was cited.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Software and hardware The software runs on a system that was written specifically for it, allowing for extensive customization for astronomical needs that would not have been possible with general purpose database software.][[0.0]]
[The scripts are designed to be as platform independent as possible, given the need to facilitate mirroring on different systems around the world, although the growing use of Linux as the operating system of choice within astronomy has led to increasing optimization of the scripts for installation on that platform.][[0.0]]
[The main ADS server is located at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and is a dual 64-bit X86 Intel server with two quad-core 3.0 GHz CPUs and 32 GB of RAM, running the CentOS 5.4 Linux distribution.][[1.0]]
[Mirrors are located in Brazil, China, Chile, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, South Korea, United Kingdom, and the Ukraine.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Indexing ADS currently receives abstracts or tables of contents from almost two hundred journal sources.][[0.0]]
[The service may receive data referring to the same article from multiple sources, and creates one bibliographic reference based on the most accurate data from each source.][[0.0]]
[The common use of TeX and LaTeX by almost all scientific journals greatly facilitates the incorporation of bibliographic data into the system in a standardized format, and importing HTML-coded web-based articles is also simple.][[0.0]]
[ADS utilizes Perl scripts for importing, processing and standardizing bibliographic data.][[0.0]]
[The apparently mundane task of converting author names into a standard Surname, Initial format is actually one of the more difficult to automate, due to the wide variety of naming conventions around the world and the possibility that a given name such as Davis could be a first name, middle name or surname.][[0.0]]
[The accurate conversion of names requires a detailed knowledge of the names of authors active in astronomy, and ADS maintains an extensive database of author names, which is also used in searching the database -LRB-see below-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[For electronic articles, a list of the references given at the end of the article is easily extracted.][[0.0]]
[For scanned articles, reference extraction relies on OCR.][[0.0]]
[The reference database can then be ``inverted'' to list the citations for each paper in the database.][[0.0]]
[Citation lists have been used in the past to identify popular articles missing from the database; mostly these were from before 1975 and have now been added to the system.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Coverage The database now contains over eight million articles.][[0.0]]
[In the cases of the major journals of astronomy -LRB-Astrophysical Journal, Astronomical Journal, Astronomy and Astrophysics, Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific and the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society-RRB-, coverage is complete, with all issues indexed from number 1 to the present.][[0.0]]
[These journals account for about two-thirds of the papers in the database, with the rest consisting of papers published in over 100 other journals from around the world.][[0.0]]
[While the database contains the complete contents of all the major journals and many minor ones as well, its coverage of references and citations is much less complete.][[0.0]]
[References in and citations of articles in the major journals are fairly complete, but references such as ``private communication'', ``in press'' or ``in preparation'' cannot be matched, and author errors in reference listings also introduce potential errors.][[0.0]]
[Astronomical papers may cite and be cited by articles in journals which fall outside the scope of ADS, such as chemistry, mathematics or biology journals.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Search engine Since its inception, the ADS has developed a highly complex search engine to query the abstract and object databases.][[0.0]]
[The search engine is tailor-made for searching astronomical abstracts, and the engine and its user interface assume that the user is well-versed in astronomy and able to interpret search results which are designed to return more than just the most relevant papers.][[0.0]]
[The database can be queried for author names, astronomical object names, title words, and words in the abstract text, and results can be filtered according to a number of criteria.][[0.0]]
[It works by first gathering synonyms and simplifying search terms as described above, and then generating an ``inverted file'', which is a list of all the documents matching each search term.][[0.0]]
[The user-selected logic and filters are then applied to this inverted list to generate the final search results.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Author name queries The system indexes author names by surname and initials, and accounts for the possible variations in spelling of names using a list of variations.][[0.0]]
[This is common in the case of names including accents such as umlauts and transliterations from Arabic or Cyrillic script.][[0.0]]
[An example of an entry in the author synonym list is: -LSB-edit-RSB- Object name searches The capability to search for papers on specific astronomical objects is one of ADS's most powerful tools.][[0.0]]
[The system uses data from the SIMBAD, the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database, the International Astronomical Union Circulars and the Lunar and Planetary Institute to identify papers referring to a given object, and can also search by object position, listing papers which concern objects within a 10�arcminute radius of a given Right Ascension and Declination.][[0.0]]
[These databases combine the many catalogue designations an object might have, so that a search for the Pleiades will also find papers which list the famous open cluster in Taurus under any of its other catalog designations or popular names, such as M45, the Seven Sisters or Melotte 22.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Title and abstract searches The search engine first filters search terms in several ways.][[0.0]]
[An M followed by a space or hyphen has the space or hyphen removed, so that searching for Messier catalogue objects is simplified and a user input of M45, M 45 or M-45 all result in the same query being executed; similarly, NGC designations and common search terms such as Shoemaker Levy and T Tauri are stripped of spaces.][[0.0]]
[Unimportant words such as AT, OR and TO are stripped out, although in some cases case sensitivity is maintained, so that while and is ignored, And is converted to ``Andromedae'', and Her is converted to ``Herculis'', but her is ignored.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Synonym replacement Once search terms have been pre-processed, the database is queried with the revised search term, as well as synonyms for it.][[0.0]]
[As well as simple synonym replacement such as searching for both plural and singular forms, ADS also searches for a large number of specifically astronomical synonyms.][[0.0]]
[For example, spectrograph and spectroscope have basically the same meaning, and in an astronomical context metallicity and abundance are also synonymous.][[0.0]]
[ADS's synonym list was created manually, by grouping the list of words in the database according to similar meanings.][[0.0]]
[As well as English language synonyms, ADS also searches for English translations of foreign search terms and vice versa, so that a search for the French word soleil retrieves references to Sun, and papers in languages other than English can be returned by English search terms.][[0.0]]
[Synonym replacement can be disabled if required, so that a rare term which is a synonym of a much more common term -LRB-such as `dateline' rather than `date'-RRB- can be searched for specifically.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Selection logic The search engine allows selection logic both within fields and between fields.][[0.0]]
[Search terms in each field can be combined with OR, AND, simple logic or Boolean logic, and the user can specify which fields must be matched in the search results.][[0.0]]
[This allows complex searches to be built; for example, the user could search for papers concerning NGC 6543 OR NGC 7009, with the paper titles containing -LRB-radius OR velocity-RRB- AND NOT -LRB-abundance OR temperature-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Result filtering Search results can be filtered according to a number of criteria, including specifying a range of years such as '1945 to 1975', '2000 to the present day' or `before 1900', and what type of journal the article appears in -- non-peer reviewed articles such as conference proceedings can be excluded or specifically searched for, or specific journals can be included in or excluded from the search.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Search results Although it was conceived as a means of accessing abstracts and papers, ADS provides a substantial amount of ancillary information along with search results.][[0.0]]
[For each abstract returned, links are provided to other papers in the database which are referenced, and which cite the paper, and a link is provided to a preprint, where one exists.][[0.0]]
[The system also generates a link to `also-read' articles -- that is, those which have been most commonly accessed by those reading the article.][[0.0]]
[In this way, an ADS user can determine which papers are of most interest to astronomers who are interested in the subject of a given paper.][[0.0]]
[Also returned are links to the SIMBAD and/or NASA Extragalactic Database object name databases, via which a user can quickly find out basic observational data about the objects analyzed in a paper, and find further papers on those objects.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Impact on astronomy ADS is almost universally used as a research tool among astronomers, and there are several studies that have estimated quantitatively how much more efficient ADS has made astronomy; one estimated that ADS increased the efficiency of astronomical research by 333�full-time equivalent research years per year, and another found that in 2002 its effect was equivalent to 736�full-time researchers, or all the astronomical research done in France.][[1.0]]
[ADS has allowed literature searches that would previously have taken days or weeks to carry out to be completed in seconds, and it is estimated that ADS has increased the readership and use of the astronomical literature by a factor of about three since its inception.][[1.0]]
[In monetary terms, this increase in efficiency represents a considerable amount.][[0.0]]
[There are about 12,000�active astronomical researchers worldwide, so ADS is the equivalent of about 5% of the working population of astronomers.][[0.0]]
[The global astronomical research budget is estimated at between 4,000 and 5,000�million USD, so the value of ADS to astronomy would be about 200--250�million USD annually.][[1.0]]
[Its operating budget is a small fraction of this amount.][[0.0]]
[The great importance of ADS to astronomers has been recognized by the United Nations, the General Assembly of which has commended ADS on its work and success, particularly noting its importance to astronomers in the developing world, in reports of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space.][[0.0]]
[A 2002 report by a visiting committee to the Center for Astrophysics, meanwhile, said that the service had ``revolutionized the use of the astronomical literature'', and was ``probably the most valuable single contribution to astronomy research that the CfA has made in its lifetime''.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Sociological studies using ADS Because it is used almost universally by astronomers, ADS can reveal much about how astronomical research is distributed around the world.][[0.0]]
[Most users access the system from institutes of higher education, whose IP address can easily be used to determine the user's geographical location.][[0.0]]
[Studies reveal that the highest per-capita users of ADS are France and Netherlands-based astronomers, and while more developed countries -LRB-measured by GDP per capita-RRB- use the system more than less developed countries; the relationship between GDP per capita and ADS use is not linear.][[0.0]]
[The range of ADS usage per capita far exceeds the range of GDPs per capita, and basic research carried out in a country, as measured by ADS usage, has been found to be proportional to the square of the country's GDP divided by its population.][[1.0]]
[ADS usage statistics also suggest that astronomers in more developed countries tend to be more productive than those in less developed countries.][[1.0]]
[The amount of basic research carried out is proportional to the number of astronomers in a country multiplied by the GDP per capita.][[0.0]]
[Statistics also imply that astronomers in European cultures carry out about three times as much research as those in Asian cultures, perhaps suggesting cultural differences in the importance attached to astronomical research.][[0.0]]
[ADS has also been used to show that the fraction of single-author astronomy papers has decreased substantially since 1975 and that astronomical papers with more than 50 authors have become more common since 1990.][[0.0]]

[-LSB-edit-RSB- Party backgrounds -LSB-edit-RSB- Australian Labor Party The Australian Labor Party is Australia's oldest political party, founded in 1891.][[0.0]]
[It is a centre-left social democratic party which is formally linked to the trade union labour movement.][[0.0]]
[On a state level, Labor has been in government since 2002, after having been in opposition from 1993 to 2002.][[0.0]]
[Since the 1970 election ending decades of electoral malapportionment of the Playmander, nine of 12 elections have been won by Labor.][[0.0]]

[-LSB-edit-RSB- Liberal Party of Australia The Liberal Party of Australia is a centre-right conservative liberal party -LRB-see Liberalism in Australia-RRB-, with close links to business and advocating free markets.][[0.0]]
[Whilst primarily a social conservative party, there exists a more social liberal wing, colloquially known as `wet', `moderate' or small-l liberals, highlighted by the short-lived Liberal Movement who first contested the 1975 election as a separate party led by Steele Hall.][[0.0]]
[At state level, the Liberal Party of Australia in 1973 descended from the Liberal and Country League -LRB-LCL-RRB-, which resulted from a merger between the Liberal Federation and the then-Country Party in 1932.][[0.0]]
[The state opposition leader at the 2006 election, Rob Kerin, was factionally nonaligned.][[1.0]]

[First contesting the 1965 election, they have only held two seats at alternating periods; Flinders -LRB-1973--1993-RRB- and Chaffey -LRB-1997--current-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Their sole member and leader, Karlene Maywald, representing the Riverland district of Chaffey, accepted a cabinet position in the Rann Labor government, as Minister for the River Murray, Minister for Regional Development, Minister for Small Business, and later Minister for Water Security.][[0.0]]
[This informal ALP-NAT coalition -LRB-the first since 1935-RRB- caused uproar, with Christopher Pyne calling for Maywald's expulsion from the Nationals and Patrick Secker calling for a corruption enquiry in to the appointment -- neither eventuated.][[0.0]]

[-LSB-edit-RSB- SA Greens The SA Greens, founded in 1995 are a sub-division of the left-wing Australian Greens.][[0.0]]
[They are based on green politics and consider themselves a new politics party with strong beliefs in ecology, democracy and social justice amongst other issues.][[0.0]]
[Federally and locally they have seen a continued rise in primary votes, in part due to the demise of the Australian Democrats.][[0.0]]

[-LSB-edit-RSB- Electoral system South Australia is governed according to the principles of the Westminster system, a form of parliamentary government based on the model of the United Kingdom.][[0.0]]
[Legislative power rests with the Parliament of South Australia, which consists of The Sovereign -LRB-represented by the Governor of South Australia-RRB-, the House of Assembly -LRB-lower house-RRB- which forms government, and the Legislative Council -LRB-upper house-RRB- as a house of review.][[0.0]]
[Forty-seven members of the lower house represent single-member electorates and are elected under the preferential Instant-runoff voting -LRB-IRV-RRB- system for fixed four-year terms.][[0.0]]
[The independent State Electoral Office, which conducts elections, is responsible for a mandatory redistricting of boundaries before each election to ensure one vote one value.][[1.0]]
[At each election, voters choose half of the 22 upper house members, each of whom serve eight-year terms in a single statewide electorate.][[0.0]]
[The Legislative Council is elected under the preferential Single Transferable Vote -LRB-STV-RRB- system through a means of Group voting tickets.][[0.0]]
[Voters can choose to vote for a ticket by placing the number '1' in one of the ticket boxes ``above the line'' or can vote for individual candidates by numbering all the boxes ``below the line'' -LRB-54 in the 2006 election-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[In above the line voting, ticket votes are distributed according to the party or group voting ticket registered before the election with the election management body.][[0.0]]
[As most ballot papers are above the line, this form of voting often leads to pre-election trading between parties on how each party will allocate later preferences to other parties and candidates.][[0.0]]
[Voting is compulsory once enrolled in South Australian elections, which results in turnout rates above 90 percent.][[0.0]]
[Informal voting, which occurs when a voting slip is not valid, is at a rate of under five percent.][[0.0]]
[Voting slips are informal when they are not filled out correctly, such examples are not numbering subsequent numbers, not filling out all the candidate boxes with numbers -LRB-except the last candidate-RRB-, or in some other way that is verified by the State Electoral Office as illegible.][[0.0]]
[South Australian elections have some features that are unique to the rest of Australia.][[0.0]]
[As elections have fixed four-year terms, the election date of 18 March 2006 was known well ahead of time.][[0.0]]
[The Electoral Act stipulates that the election is to be held on the third Saturday in March every four years.][[0.0]]

[As 24 seats are required to govern, the Liberal Party was expected to retain government with the support of all four independents.][[0.0]]
[However, in a surprise decision, one of the conservative independents, Peter Lewis, decided to support Labor in exchange for holding a constitutional convention, making him speaker of the House of Assembly, and concessions for his electorate including the phasing out of commercial fishing in the River Murray, prioritising the eradication of the branched broomrape weed, changing water rates for irrigation, fast-tracking a feasibility study for a weir and lock at Wellington, and improving rural roads.][[0.0]]
[Lewis resigned as speaker in April 2005 after controversy over allegations of paedophilia he had made about a serving MP.][[0.0]]
[However, by this time, Labor had already gained the support of independents Bob Such and Rory McEwen in 2002, as well as Nationals SA member Karlene Maywald in 2004.][[1.0]]

[Conlon complained that the advertisement gave the false impression that he was endorsing Labor, but Labor campaign director David Feeney dismissed his concerns.][[0.0]]
[Other negative advertisements run by Labor revolved around the actions of the previous Liberal government -- one advertisement and leaflet reminded voters that while in power, the previous Liberal government closed 65 schools, closed hospital wards, and privatised the Electricity Trust of South Australia.][[0.0]]
[Considered ``strapped for cash'', the Liberal Party ran a very limited television and radio campaign.][[0.0]]
[Businessman Robert Gerard was forced to resign from his Federal Liberal Party-appointed position on the board of the Reserve Bank of Australia due to the party appointing him to the position despite the known fact that he had outstanding tax avoidance issues being dealt with by the Australian Taxation Office, and had thus subsequently pulled out of his traditional role of bankrolling the state division of the party, leaving the party with ``only enough funds for the most basic campaign''.][[0.0]]
[Kerin indicated people would have to ``wait and see'' if there would be any campaign, even asking trade unions for donations, no matter how small.][[0.0]]

[The following year the family acquired 200�acres -LRB-80�ha-RRB- along the Red River.][[0.0]]
[They sold that property in 1800 and relocated to Missouri before moving to Spanish Louisiana in 1802, where they settled on Bushley Bayou in Rapides Parish.][[0.0]]
[The Bowie family moved again in 1809, settling on Bayou Teche in Louisiana before finding a permanent home in Opelousas in 1812.][[0.0]]

Document 14 142
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Background -LSB-edit-RSB- Gulag A year before the uprising, the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin died.][[0.0]]
[His death raised great hopes among the prisoners of amnesty or, failing that, prison reform, and this hope was further emboldened by the subsequent downfall of Stalin's right hand man and state security chief, Lavrenty Beria.][[0.0]]
[Beria, who was the chief of the entire Soviet security and police apparatus and architect of some of the most hated policies relating to the camps, was declared an ``enemy of the people'' and executed by those who succeeded Stalin.][[0.0]]
[Beria's newly besmirched name became a liability to others in both the upper and lower echelons of the Soviet hierarchy, and anybody who was associated with or spoke too much in favour of Beria was similarly at risk of being denounced as a traitor and persecuted.][[0.0]]
[The camp administration were not excluded from this risk, and this fact in turn significantly weakened their position vis à vis the prisoners.][[0.0]]
[Writing about the strikes which were taking place at the time, Solzhenitsyn described this issue: Prisoners all over gulag, for this reason and others, were becoming increasingly bold and impudent in the months preceding the uprising, with hunger strikes, work stoppages, large-scale insubordination, and punitive violence becoming more and more common.][[0.0]]
[In Kengir in particular, camp authorities were rapidly losing all control over their charges, and the communiques periodically sent by commanders up the camp hierarchy, in which they expressed their horror at the frequent incidents of unrest, powerful underground organizations, the growing ``crisis'' afflicting their network of informants, and their desperate attempts to reassert control, attest to this.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Kengir -LSB-edit-RSB- Thieves The uprising's roots can be traced back to a large in-shipment of ``thieves'' -- the accepted slang term for the habitual criminals who were also imprisoned in Gulag along with the political prisoners.][[0.0]]
[Traditionally thieves and politicals had been antagonists, with the thieves exercising virtually unchecked dominance over the politicals, robbing and abusing them at will, and with the politicals remaining too disunited to muster a credible defense.][[0.0]]
[This situation was facilitated by a variably complacent and actively encouraging camp administration, which recognized the potential of thieves as an effective means of suppressing the politicals and preventing them from uniting in a common cause.][[0.0]]
[Indeed, the infusion of roughly 650 thieves into the roughly 8,000-strong body of political prisoners at Kengir at the beginning of May was specifically for this purpose, as the Kengir prisoners had organized strikes before on a smaller scale and were becoming increasingly restless.][[0.0]]
[The camp authorities hoped that these thieves would, as they had in the past, help reverse this trend.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Stoolies It is important to note that, while the Gulag labour camps were founded in the early 1920s, only in the early 1950s were the politicals and thieves finally separated into different camp systems.][[0.0]]
[With the thieves out of the way, the politicals began to unite in ways unprecedented in Gulag.][[0.0]]
[The building blocks of this process were national, religious, and ethnic groups -LRB-Ukrainians, Kazakhs, Chechens, Armenians, Estonians, Muslims, etc.-RRB- who quickly consolidated into strong groups and led the way towards the building of a camp-wide coalition, primarily by launching huge campaigns of murder against camp ``stoolies'' -LRB-or stool pigeons-RRB--- a widely used term for snitches or prisoners who otherwise colluded in any way with the camp administration.][[0.0]]
[Along with the thieves, the stoolies were the primary impediment to the politicals uniting together in the past.][[0.0]]
[The stoolies kept their identities secret, denounced fellow prisoners often, and worked assiduously to root out and finger potentially troublesome prisoners.][[0.0]]
[Because of this, a massive chilling effect was created among prisoners, who feared opening up to or trusting each other.][[0.0]]
[These national and ethnic blocks, though, began the fight against the stoolies, systematically fishing out and killing them with a vigour and efficiency so great that the remaining, unidentified stoolies fled to the camp administration for protection.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Weaponry and organization Of these above mentioned ethnic blocks, the Ukrainians, many of whom were exiled members of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists -LRB-by some estimates making up over a half of the camps' population-RRB- were undoubtedly the most important, and they quickly asserted a leadership role amongst the prisoners.][[0.0]]
[Members of this ``Ukrainian Centre'', as it was often called, were the primary proponents of stoolie extermination and later would prove essential to dealing with the newly-arrived thieves.][[0.0]]
[Along with this effective elimination of stoolies, the prisoners began fashioning relatively high quality shivs, which were previously the exclusive territory of thieves.][[0.0]]
[In addition, many incidents took place -LRB-usually including the wanton murder of some well-liked prisoners by guards-RRB- during the previous months that came to fuel resentment and justify extreme action on behalf of the prisoners.][[0.0]]
[Protests and collective refusals to work were increasing in frequency and the prisoners were learning the ropes of how to plan and maintain large-scale disturbances, mainly by creating systems of communication between camp divisions and, more importantly, by establishing command hierarchies.][[0.0]]
[Into this changed climate the thieves were injected and, to the surprise of the camp authorities, they instantly joined forces with the politicals, meeting secretly on the first night with the Ukrainian Centre and establishing a pact.][[0.0]]
[This was due both to the fact that they recognized their odds against the almost 8,000 strong body of well-armed and united political prisoners, and because thieves across the whole Gulag caught wind of the politicals' campaign against the stoolies and began to admire and respect them.][[1.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- The camp compound The entire Kengir camp complex formed a large rectangle, divided up width-wise into four distinct areas: the women's camp, the ``service yard'', where all the workshops and storerooms were located, and two camps for men, each with its own jailhouse for punishing prisoners or hiding stoolies.][[1.0]]
[The women's camp was blocked off both from access and sight to the mens' camp.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Seizing of the camp The formative stage of the uprising began on the evening of 16 May, a Sunday and thus a day off for all the prisoners.][[0.0]]
[The thieves contrived to break into the service yard, where all the food was stored, and from there break into the women's camp, which was easier to do from that location.][[0.0]]
[This they initially did, but they were shortly chased off by guards.][[0.0]]
[At nightfall, though, the thieves regrouped, shot out all of the lights in range with their slingshots, and broke through the barrier between the men's camp and service yard with an improvised battering ram.][[0.0]]
[It was at this point the Kengir uprising proper started when the guards opened fire on the thieves, killing 13 and wounding 43.][[0.0]]
[The remaining thieves retreated and an uneasy peace followed.][[0.0]]
[During the night, though, thieves, now joined by the politicals, started breaking up their bunks and cells, trying to add to their cache of shivs and arm those without weapons, while the camp authorities posted machine gunners at the hole in the wall.][[0.0]]
[After a tense standoff, the camp authorities, in a surprise gesture, ordered the withdrawal of all guards from the compound.][[0.0]]
[Despite appearances, this was a strictly tactical move on the part of the authorities.][[0.0]]
[The following day they feigned acquiescence to the prisoners demands and, while the prisoners then agreeably went off to work outside the camp, the guards busied themselves patching up the broken-down wall.][[1.0]]
[Nevertheless this was a strategic error on their part because it exposed the bad faith of the guards and eliminated all remaining trust the prisoners had in their word.][[0.0]]
[More importantly, though, the prisoners had, for one whole day, tasted total freedom -LRB-within the confines of the camp compound-RRB-, mingling freely with the female prisoners, eating their fill, and fraternizing as they pleased, and this put in them a desire for freedom that would not be so easily quenched.][[0.0]]
[This time also saw the first propaganda offensive by the camp authorities -LRB-they re-enacted, in full prisoner costume, the alleged rape of the women prisoners and photographed themselves, releasing the photographs and declaring that the revolt was in fact a cover for debauchery and hedonism-RRB-, setting the tone for the many that would follow.][[1.0]]
[After realizing these sleights of hand on the part of the camp authorities, the prisoners quickly and forcefully reasserted themselves, running amok and sending the guards fleeing from the camp again.][[0.0]]
[They then proceeded to re-destroy the wall that had just been repaired and release the prisoners from the camp's solitary confinement cells.][[0.0]]
[The camp had been seized and would remain in the control of the prisoners for the next 40 days.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- The new camp society -LSB-edit-RSB- Culture With the entire camp at their disposal, and with feelings of fellowship and good-will in abundance, prisoners took part in a hurried romp through the joys of normal, human, everyday life that had been denied to them for so long.][[0.0]]
[As Solzhenitsyn and others retold, men and women from different camp divisions who had romantically conversed in secret for years, but had never seen each other, finally met.][[0.0]]
[Imprisoned priests presided over a number of improvised weddings.][[0.0]]
[Prisoners retrieved what remained of their civilian clothing from the storeroom -LRB-the guards regularly stole and sold prisoners' items-RRB-, and soon prisoners were seen adorned with fur coats and assorted colourful clothing, in addition to the religious wear that had been banned.][[0.0]]
[Business, as well, resumed as best it could, with one Polish aristocrat opening up a ``café'' serving ersatz ``coffee'', which proved to be quite popular with the prisoners.][[0.0]]
[In short order, a number of organized recreational activities also sprung up.][[0.0]]
[Because of the large number of political prisoners in Gulag, almost every camp boasted an enviable selection of highly-skilled and trained engineers, scientists, intellectuals, and artists, and advanced lectures were delivered for the enjoyment of the educated classes and philistines alike.][[0.0]]
[Art flourished as well, with poetry recitals and even hastily-prepared plays being performed.][[0.0]]
[Hymns, penned by the Ukrainians, were performed en masse.][[0.0]]
[One hymn in particular, with its simultaneously mournful and celebratory tone and its stirring demand for freedom, stands as representative of the prevailing themes in the works produced during the uprising: In addition to the renewed presence of religious regalia, religious practices were also given new life.][[0.0]]
[Notably, one of the religious sects massed at the original hole broken into the dividing wall on the first night of the uprising, claiming that their prophet had predicted its destruction and the freedom that followed.][[0.0]]
[They, according to former prisoners, then sat on mattresses for several days by the hole, praying and waiting to be taken to heaven.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Government Soon after the camp was taken over, the prisoners congregated into the mess hall and decided to elect a new leader, and a former Red Army Colonel, Kapiton Kuznetsov, was chosen.][[0.0]]
[A major reason for this choice was that the Ukrainian Center insisted on having Russian leadership of the rebellion and, indeed, on having the entire government be as multiethnic and multinational as possible.][[0.0]]
[This was done mainly to avoid the appearance of the rebellion being anti-Russian in character, but also as an enlightened attempt to create a harmonious camp society and government.][[0.0]]
[Kuznetsov and his administration were originally delegated to conduct negotiations with the camp authorities on behalf of the prisoners, but as the prisoners' control of the camp lasted beyond expectation and as demand for law, order, and efficiency increased, the jurisdiction of this government increased in turn.][[0.0]]
[Therefore, various government departments were quickly created:  -LSB-edit-RSB- Propaganda The first expansion of the government's authority came as a natural extension of its role as mouthpiece of the prisoners: propaganda.][[0.0]]
[A theme was carefully set by Kuznetsov and taken over by his Lithuanian deputy, Knopkus.][[0.0]]
[The theme crucially undercut the main argument that would have been used by the camp authorities to crush the rebellion, which was that the rebellion was anti-Soviet in nature.][[0.0]]
[Even with Stalin dead, this represented a red-line that was not to be crossed.][[0.0]]
[Instead, Knopkus schemed to portray the guards as ``Beria-ites'' -LRB-a deadly charge at the time-RRB- and the rebellion as a patriotic, vanguard movement against them.][[0.0]]
[Soon placards were raised declaring such sentiments as ``Long live the Soviet constitution!''][[0.0]]
[and ``Down with murdering Beria-ites!''][[0.0]]
[As the new state of affairs continued, the Propaganda department's activities grew.][[0.0]]
[At first they were all largely defensive in intent -- literally just responding to allegations hurled at them across the fence.][[0.0]]
[The guards broadcast propaganda over loudspeakers into the camp, urging surrender and decrying the loss of days of valuable prison labor and the alleged detrimental effect it was having on the Soviet economy.][[0.0]]
[In response, the prisoners, using a modified loudspeaker, broadcast back a whole set of mock radio programmes, complete with comedy programs and skits, written by the Agitation and Propaganda department and announced by a charismatic female prisoner.][[0.0]]
[One of the guard's stenographers recorded some of the broadcasts, and these records made their way into the Soviet archives.][[0.0]]
[An excerpt of one broadcast: Later, with the help of the Technical Department, their schemes became increasingly ambitious.][[0.0]]
[The prisoners, realizing the precariousness of their situation, endeavored to publicize their rebellion and demands to the village adjacent to the camp, hoping to incite its citizens to supportive action.][[0.0]]
[To do this, they first employed specially rigged, hot air balloons with slogans written on them -LRB-these were shot down by the guards-RRB- and, later, kites manufactured by the Chechens, who turned out to be specialists in the field.][[0.0]]
[The kites were successful for a time.][[0.0]]
[In favorable winds, they dropped packets of leaflets to the settlements below, but the authorities soon sent up their own kites to tangle the prisoner's kite's lines.][[0.0]]
[At last, seizing on a solid, successful strategy, the prisoners fixed leaflets to carrier pigeons, releasing dozens into the blue.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Defense Along with propaganda, defense came to the fore of the new government's list of priorities.][[0.0]]
[Before the exiled camp authorities cut off the camp's electricity, the smiths and lathe-operators in the camp fashioned all manner of weaponry in the service yard's workshops -- long pikes from prison bars, sabers, staves, and clubs amongst them.][[0.0]]
[In addition to this, the prisoners ground glass into dust and placed buckets of this dust throughout the camp, hoping to blind oncoming troops with it.][[0.0]]
[Barricades were established at key points, and responsibility for manning them was divided up amongst the camp barracks -LRB-renamed ``detachments'' by the Defense department-RRB-, with set shifts and procedures.][[0.0]]
[The Technical Department contributed to this effort as well, namely by creating improvised explosive devices and incendiary bombs, both of which, according to Solzhenitsyn, saw use during the actual invasion in June, the latter bringing down a guard tower.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Technical Department In addition to the above mentioned innovations, the Technical Department dealt with any number of problems that arose.][[0.0]]
[When the exiled camp authorities cut off the camp's electrical supply, the electricians among the prisoners siphoned electricity from the wires passing overhead just outside the perimeter fence.][[0.0]]
[This too was terminated by the authorities after a few days, and thereafter the prisoners used a modified motor as a generator and even improvised a running tap ``hydroelectric station'' to supply power to the government headquarters and medical barracks.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Negotiations Negotiations between the authorities and rebels began almost immediately, as was becoming the custom with prisoner disturbances, but were from the beginning wrought with difficulty.][[0.0]]
[The camp authorities again immediately acquiesced to virtually all of the prisoners demands, but this time, with the past deceit still fresh in their minds, the prisoners did not accept this solution as sufficient and demanded a written agreement.][[1.0]]
[A draft was written up by the authorities, passed around the camp and widely panned.][[0.0]]
[From here negotiations cooled until higher ranking officers came in from other cities.][[0.0]]
[Solzhenitsyn explained: To these generals and others were presented the same set of demands: punishment of the soldiers responsible for the murder of various prisoners and beating of women prisoners; that prisoners who had been transferred to other camps as punishment for participating in a strike be brought back; that prisoners no longer had to wear degrading number patches or be locked into their dormitories at night; that the walls separating camp divisions -LRB-namely between the men's and women's camps-RRB- not be rebuilt; that an eight-hour work day be instituted; that limits be taken off the number of letters they could send and receive; that certain hated camp guards and officials be removed from Kengir; and that, most importantly, their cases be reviewed.][[0.0]]
[None of these demands were unconstitutional.][[0.0]]
[The original regulation specifically provided for all that the prisoners were asking, and that a simple reinstatement of those rights was all that was being requested.][[0.0]]
[The generals, now with Sergei Yegorov, deputy chief of the MVD, and Ivan Dolgikh, division commander of Gulag, among them, once again agreed to the prisoners demands as whole, but, still failing to match a written contract to their words, they were once again rejected by the prisoners.][[0.0]]
[The discussions then further broke down into threats and counter-threats.][[0.0]]
[The prisoners, out of a lack of trust in their current negotiating partners, demanded that a member of the Central Committee be sent and this was flatly refused.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Sowing discord Prior to the raid, attempts were made by the camp authorities to sow civil violence within the camp, both so that the prisoners would slaughter each other and make the job easier for the invading troops, and to provide an ostensible justification for the massive armed intervention to begin with.][[0.0]]
[Direct requests were made to high ranking prisoners that they ``provoke racial bloodbath'' and, in exchange, get to keep their lives -LRB-any prisoner that publicly occupied a high post in the camp's provisional government was sure to be tried and executed when captured, as the prisoners themselves knew-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Banking on the still-running current of paranoia and distrust of Jews in Russia, the authorities even attempted to spread rumours in the camp that a pogrom was imminent as a way of dividing prisoners against each other.][[0.0]]
[While these efforts largely failed, another objective of the authorities -- to draw out orthodox Communists and Soviet loyalists -- was successful and a number of them fled the camp in the days before the raid, including a high ranking member of the prisoner's government who would later reappear as a voice urging surrender on the guards' propaganda loudspeakers.][[0.0]]
[Nevertheless, this outflow was shortly halted by Internal Security, which captured those speaking favorably of the authorities or of surrender and locked them in the camp's jail.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Suppression -LSB-edit-RSB- Prelude In the days prior to the raid, small, token incursions were made.][[0.0]]
[First, this was done to test the preparedness and defensive capabilities of the prisoners -- alarms were sounded and prisoners quickly assumed battle positions -- but later it was done for the sake of running film cameras.][[0.0]]
[This footage later became important to the authorities in their effort to identify and punish all those who participated directly in the uprising, as well as secure their justification for the raid.][[0.0]]
[At this time, the morale of the prisoners was also dropping.][[0.0]]
[Many came to have a dawning sense of the futility of their own struggle, and this attitude proved infectious.][[0.0]]
[The leader of the prisoners, Kuznetsov, even betrayed his wariness in a speech, retold by Solzhenitsyn: Making matters worse for the prisoners, the day before the raid it was announced on the guards' loudspeakers that their demand to meet with a member of the Central Committee was to be granted.][[0.0]]
[This had the effect of lowering the prisoners guard and creating a less hostile and more favourable disposition towards the camp authorities, who were planning to violently crush the prisoners all the while.][[0.0]]
[In addition, Solzhenitsyn recalls that the prisoners heard for days before the raid what they thought were the sounds of tractors running on the distance, out of sight.][[0.0]]
[These turned out to be tanks, a weapon the prisoners did not anticipate being used against them.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- The raid In the dawn of 25 June, flares were shot up into the sky and the raid began.][[0.0]]
[Snipers quickly picked off the sentries on the rooftops before they could sound the alarm, and the tanks rolled through the perimeter fence.][[0.0]]
[Five tanks, 90 dogs, and 1,700 troops in full battle-gear stormed the camp complex.][[0.0]]
[What followed was panic and chaos.][[0.0]]
[While some `detachments' vigorously fought back, launching numerous counter-attacks despite heavy losses and throwing improvised sulfur bombs at the tanks, other prisoners hid or committed suicide.][[0.0]]
[The tanks, T-34s, alternately ran over prisoners or brought down barrack walls where prisoners were hiding, and used blank rounds of ammunition to strike terror and confusion into the prisoners.][[0.0]]
[The hundreds of helmeted Red Army soldiers that flooded the camp were using live ammunition, though, and with these many prisoners were killed.][[0.0]]
[Some tanks carried in barbed wire-laden trestles, and these were immediately set down as a means of quickly dividing up the camp and hindering the prisoners' freedom of movement.][[0.0]]
[The leaders of the uprising were specifically targeted by designated squads of soldiers and they were taken into custody alive, many of whom were later tried and executed.][[0.0]]
[After ninety minutes of violence, the remaining live prisoners, most of whom were in hiding, were ordered to come out on the promise that they wouldn't be shot, which was, to everyone's surprise, a promise kept.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Aftermath According to a number of survivors of the camp, five to seven hundred prisoners were either killed or wounded in the uprising, with an additional six of the highest ranking prisoners later being executed, Knopkus among them.][[1.0]]
[Figures found in the Soviet archives, though, suggest that only 37 were killed, not including those who later died of their wounds or were executed, and with 106 prisoners and 40 soldiers wounded.][[0.0]]
[Kuznetsov, however, had his death sentence commuted to 25 years and found himself released and fully rehabilitated after 5 years of imprisonment.][[0.0]]
[Theories abound as to why, but most attribute this to the full, detailed 43-page confession he wrote in which he denounced scores of fellow prisoners.][[0.0]]
[This confession also proved to be an invaluable source for many of the studies conducted on the Kengir uprising, although some question its veracity.][[0.0]]
[In keeping with the prevailing theme of their story, the camp administration is said to have planted weapons on the corpses of those who didn't already have them for the sake of the photographers, who were brought in expressly for this purpose.][[0.0]]
[On the day following the raid, almost a thousand prisoners were shipped off to different camps and the remaining prisoners were occupied with the task of, once again, rebuilding the destroyed wall, sealing themselves back into a life of imprisonment.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Significance Among the strikes and rebellions that were taking place in Gulags across the Soviet Union in this period, the uprising at Kengir was perhaps the most significant.][[1.0]]
[While Stalin's death, Beria's fall, and Khrushchev's rise bore much promise for the prisoners, who had long expected general amnesties and rehabilitation to follow these events, the role of the Kengir uprising in hastening this process cannot be overlooked.][[0.0]]
[The uprising further demonstrated to the authorities that Stalinism was not a sustainable policy option and that mass injustices such as those taking place in Gulag would not stand in perpetuity without significant cost.][[1.0]]
[In a shift that foreboded poorly for the Soviet regime, many of the prisoners took part knowing full well that they were doing so at the cost of their lives, and prisoners in other camps, namely in the nearby Rudnik camp, had joined with the Kengir prisoners in solidarity, launching their own short-lived strikes.][[0.0]]
[The significance of the temporary freedom enjoyed by those prisoners was not lost on many.][[0.0]]
[In a 1978 review of Solzhenitsyn's book, Hilton Kramer of The New York Times declared that the uprising ``restored a measure of humane civilization to the prisoners before the state was able to assert its implacable power again.''][[0.0]]
[At a 2004 reunion of Kengir prisoners, a survivor of the camp mentioned that, despite the brutality and loss of life that came with the uprising's suppression, the 40 days engendered the prisoners with ``a great feeling of freeing one's spirit'', and another prisoner recalled that ``I had not before then, and have not since, felt such a sense of freedom as I did then'' -- both sentiments echoed often by Solzhenitsyn.][[1.0]]
[Indeed, Solzhenitsyn would later dedicate a screenplay he had written to the bravery of the Kengir rebels, entitled Tanks Know the Truth -LRB-Знают истину танки-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Most remarkably, as George Mason University historian Steven A. Barnes noted in a 2005 edition of Slavic Review, the prisoners' campaign was belied with a certain pragmatism, and their propaganda with a level of skill, that was all but unprecedented.][[0.0]]
[As noted, instead of making explicit their hostility to the Soviet regime and handing an excuse to the authorities to invade, they ostensibly expressed approval of the state while, meekly, asking for the restoration of the rights and privileges afforded to them in the Soviet constitution.][[0.0]]
[This message was itself spread not only to the camp authorities and any of the MVD-brass that would visit the camp for negotiations, but, crucially, to the civilian population surrounding the camp.][[0.0]]
[Before the authorities came up with the idea of using their own rival kites to tangle and bring down the prisoner's kites with, they kept a large retinue of guards and warders, on horseback and motorcycle, waiting for the leaflets to be dropped from the kites so that they could, literally, chase down and retrieve them before they could be read by members of the public.][[0.0]]
[The tact, cohesion, and ingenuity displayed in the uprising was a troubling sign to the authorities of what was perhaps to come.][[0.0]]
[Nevertheless, any potential effect the uprising could have had was strictly circumscribed by the nature of the Soviet regime, which was quick to use massive force to quell even the most humble of threats.][[0.0]]
[In the same Times review, Kramer issued an important caveat to his previous claim:][[0.0]]

[The largest known skull measures 99�centimeters -LRB-39�in-RRB- long, just slightly smaller than that of Daspletosaurus.][[0.0]]
[As in other tyrannosaurids, the skull was large compared to its body size, although chambers within the skull bones and large openings -LRB-fenestrae-RRB- between bones reduced its weight.][[0.0]]
[Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus share proportionally longer and lower skulls than Daspletosaurus and other tyrannosaurids.][[0.0]]
[The end of the snout was blunt, and the nasal and parietal bones were fused along the midline of the skull, as in all other members of the family.][[0.0]]
[The eye socket was circular rather than oval or keyhole-shaped as in other tyrannosaurid genera.][[0.0]]
[A tall crest rose from the lacrimal bone in front of each eye, similar to Albertosaurus and Daspletosaurus.][[0.0]]
[Differences in the shape of bones surrounding the brain set Gorgosaurus apart from Albertosaurus.][[0.0]]
[Gorgosaurus teeth were typical of all known tyrannosaurids.][[1.0]]
[The eight premaxillary teeth at the front of the snout were smaller than the rest, closely packed and D-shaped in cross section.][[0.0]]
[In Gorgosaurus, the first tooth in the maxilla was also shaped like the premaxillary teeth.][[0.0]]
[The rest of the teeth were oval in cross section, rather than blade-like as in most other theropods.][[0.0]]
[Along with the eight premaxillary teeth, Gorgosaurus had 26 to 30�maxillary teeth and 30 to 34�teeth in the dentary bones of the lower jaw.][[0.0]]

[Gorgosaurus shared its general body plan with all other tyrannosaurids.][[0.0]]
[Its massive head was perched on the end of an S-shaped neck.][[0.0]]
[In contrast to its large head, its forelimbs were very small.][[0.0]]
[The forelimbs had only two digits, although a third metacarpal is known in some specimens, the vestigial remains of the third digit seen in other theropods.][[0.0]]
[Gorgosaurus had four digits on each hindlimb, including a small first toe -LRB-hallux-RRB- which did not contact the ground.][[0.0]]
[Tyrannosaurid hindlimbs were long relative to overall body size compared with other theropods.][[0.0]]
[The largest known Gorgosaurus femur measured 105�centimeters -LRB-41�in-RRB- long.][[0.0]]
[In several smaller specimens of Gorgosaurus, the tibia was longer than the femur, a proportion typical of fast-running animals.][[0.0]]
[The two bones were of equal length in the largest specimens.][[0.0]]

[The close similarities between Gorgosaurus libratus and Albertosaurus sarcophagus have led many experts to combine them into one genus over the years.][[1.0]]
[Albertosaurus was named first, so by convention it is given priority over the name Gorgosaurus, which is sometimes considered its junior synonym.][[0.0]]

[Gorgosaurus libratus was formally reassigned to Albertosaurus -LRB-as Albertosaurus libratus-RRB- by Dale Russell in 1970, and many subsequent authors followed his lead.][[0.0]]

[In 1856, Joseph Leidy described two tyrannosaurid premaxillary teeth from Montana.][[0.0]]
[Although there was no indication of what the animal looked like, the teeth were large and robust, and Leidy gave them the name Deinodon.][[0.0]]
[Matthew and Brown commented in 1922 that these teeth were indistinguishable from those of Gorgosaurus, but in the absence of skeletal remains of Deinodon, opted not to synonymize the two genera.][[0.0]]
[Although Deinodon teeth are very similar to those of Gorgosaurus, tyrannosaurid teeth are extremely uniform, so it cannot be said for certain which animal they belonged to.][[0.0]]
[Deinodon is regarded as a nomen dubium today.][[0.0]]
[Several tyrannosaurid skeletons from the Judith River Formation of Montana probably belong to Gorgosaurus, although it remains uncertain whether they belong to G. libratus or a new species.][[0.0]]

[Similar-sized predators in modern predator guilds are separated into different ecological niches by anatomical, behavioral or geographical differences that limit competition.][[0.0]]
[Niche differentiation between the Dinosaur Park tyrannosaurids is not well-understood.][[1.0]]
[In 1970, Dale Russell hypothesized the more common Gorgosaurus actively hunted fleet-footed hadrosaurs, while the rarer and more troublesome ceratopsians and ankylosaurians -LRB-horned and heavily armoured dinosaurs-RRB- were left to the more heavy-built Daspletosaurus.][[1.0]]
[However, a specimen of Daspletosaurus -LRB-OTM 200-RRB- from the contemporaneous Two Medicine Formation of Montana preserves the digested remains of a juvenile hadrosaur in its gut region.][[0.0]]

[A growth curve can be developed when the ages of various individuals are plotted against their sizes on a graph.][[0.0]]
[Tyrannosaurids grew throughout their lives, but underwent tremendous growth spurts for about four years, after an extended juvenile phase.][[0.0]]
[Sexual maturity may have ended this rapid growth phase, after which growth slowed down considerably in adult animals.][[0.0]]
[Examining five Gorgosaurus specimens of various sizes, Erickson calculated a maximum growth rate of about 110�kilograms -LRB-50�lb-RRB- during the rapid growth phase, slower than in tyrannosaurines like Daspletosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, but comparable to Albertosaurus.][[0.0]]
[Gorgosaurus spent as much as half its life in the juvenile phase before ballooning up to near-maximum size in only a few years.][[0.0]]
[This, along with the complete lack of predators intermediate in size between huge adult tyrannosaurids and other small theropods, suggests these niches may have been filled by juvenile tyrannosaurids.][[0.0]]
[This is seen in modern Komodo dragons, where hatchlings start off as tree-dwelling insectivores and slowly mature into massive apex predators capable of taking down large vertebrates.][[0.0]]
[Other tyrannosaurids, including Albertosaurus, have been found in aggregations that some have suggested to represent mixed-age packs, but there is no evidence of gregarious behavior in Gorgosaurus.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Paleoecology All known specimens of Gorgosaurus libratus have been recovered from the Dinosaur Park Formation in Alberta.][[0.0]]
[This formation dates to the middle of the Campanian, between 76.5 and 74�million years ago.][[1.0]]
[At this time, the area was a coastal plain along the western edge of the Western Interior Seaway, which divided North America in half.][[0.0]]
[The Laramide Orogeny had begun uplifting the Rocky Mountains to the west, from which flowed great rivers that deposited eroded sediment in vast floodplains along the coast.][[0.0]]
[The climate was subtropical with marked seasonality, and periodic droughts sometimes resulted in massive mortality among the great herds of dinosaurs, as represented in the numerous bonebed deposits preserved in the Dinosaur Park Formation.][[0.0]]
[Conifers formed the forest canopy, while the understory plants consisted of ferns, tree ferns and angiosperms.][[0.0]]
[Around 73�million years ago, the seaway began to expand, transgressing into areas formerly above sea level and drowning the Dinosaur Park ecosystem.][[0.0]]
[This transgression, called the Bearpaw Sea, is recorded by the marine sediments of the massive Bearpaw Shale.][[0.0]]
[The Dinosaur Park Formation preserves a great wealth of vertebrate fossils.][[0.0]]
[A wide variety of fish swam the rivers and estuaries, including gars, sturgeons, sharks and rays, among others.][[0.0]]
[Frogs, salamanders, turtles, crocodilians and champsosaurs also dwelled in the aquatic habitats.][[0.0]]
[Azhdarchid pterosaurs and neornithine birds like Apatornis flew overhead, while the enantiornithine bird Avisaurus lived on the ground alongside multituberculate, marsupial and placental mammals.][[0.0]]
[A number of species of terrestrial lizards were also present, including whiptails, skinks, monitors and alligator lizards.][[0.0]]
[Dinosaur fossils in particular are found with unrivaled abundance and diversity.][[0.0]]
[Huge herds of ceratopsids roamed the floodplains alongside equally large groups of hadrosaurine and lambeosaurine hadrosaurs.][[1.0]]
[Other herbivorous groups like ornithomimids, therizinosaurs, pachycephalosaurs, small ornithopods, nodosaurids and ankylosaurids were also represented.][[0.0]]
[Small predatory dinosaurs like oviraptorosaurs, troodonts and dromaeosaurs hunted smaller prey than the huge tyrannosaurids, Daspletosaurus and Gorgosaurus, which were two orders of magnitude larger in mass.][[0.0]]

[-LSB-edit-RSB- Origins Both geologic and climatic events helped to make Australia's fauna unique.][[1.0]]
[Australia was once part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, which also included South America, Africa, India and Antarctica.][[0.0]]
[Gondwana began to break up 140�million years ago -LRB-MYA-RRB-; 50 MYA Australia separated from Antarctica and was relatively isolated until the collision of the Indo-Australian Plate with Asia in the Miocene era 5.3 MYA.][[0.0]]
[The establishment and evolution of the present-day fauna was apparently shaped by the unique climate and the geology of the continent.][[0.0]]
[As Australia drifted, it was, to some extent, isolated from the effects of global climate change.][[1.0]]
[The unique fauna that originated in Gondwana, such as the marsupials, survived and adapted in Australia.][[1.0]]
[After the Miocene, fauna of Asian origin were able to establish themselves in Australia.][[0.0]]
[The Wallace Line--the hypothetical line separating the zoogeographical regions of Asia and Australasia--marks the tectonic boundary between the Eurasian and Indo-Australian plates.][[0.0]]
[This continental boundary prevented the formation of land bridges and resulted in a distinct zoological distribution, with limited overlap, of most Asian and Australian fauna, with the exception of birds.][[0.0]]
[Following the emergence of the circumpolar current in the mid-Oligocene era -LRB-some 15 MYA-RRB-, the Australian climate became increasingly arid, giving rise to a diverse group of arid-specialised organisms, just as the wet tropical and seasonally wet areas gave rise to their own uniquely adapted species.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Mammals Australia has a rich mammalian fossil history, as well as a variety of extant mammalian species, dominated by the marsupials.][[0.0]]
[The fossil record shows that monotremes have been present in Australia since the Early Cretaceous 145--99 MYA, and that marsupials and placental mammals date from the Eocene 56--34 MYA, when modern mammals first appeared in the fossil record.][[0.0]]
[Although marsupials and placental mammals did coexist in Australia in the Eocene, only marsupials have survived to the present.][[0.0]]
[The placental mammals made their reappearance in Australia in the Miocene, when Australia moved closer to Indonesia, and bats and rodents started to appear reliably in the fossil record.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-citation needed-RSB- The marsupials evolved to fill specific ecological niches, and in many cases they are physically similar to the placental mammals in Eurasia and North America that occupy similar niches, a phenomenon known as convergent evolution.][[1.0]]
[For example, the top predator in Australia, the Tasmanian Tiger, bore a striking resemblance to canids such as the Gray Wolf;-LSB-citation needed-RSB- gliding possums and flying squirrels have similar adaptations enabling their arboreal lifestyle;-LSB-citation needed-RSB- and the Numbat and anteaters are both digging insectivores.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Birds Australia and its territories are home to around 800 species of bird; about 350 of these are endemic to the zoogeographic region that covers Australia, New Guinea and New Zealand.][[0.0]]

[The Satin Bowerbird has attracted the interest of evolutionary psychologists; it has a complex courtship ritual in which the male creates a bower filled with blue, shiny items to woo mates.][[0.0]]
[Relatively recent colonists from Eurasia are swallows,-LSB-citation needed-RSB- larks, thrushes, cisticolas, sunbirds, and some raptors, including the large Wedge-tailed Eagle.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-citation needed-RSB- A number of bird species have been introduced by humans; some, like the European Goldfinch and Greenfinch, coexist happily with Australian species,-LSB-citation needed-RSB- while others, such as the Common Starling, Common Blackbird, House Sparrow and Indian Mynah, are destructive of some native bird species and thus destabilise the native ecosystem.][[0.0]]
[About 200 species of seabird live on the Australian coast, including many species of migratory seabird.][[0.0]]
[Australia is at the southern end of the East Asian-Australasian flyway for migratory water birds, which extends from Far-East Russia and Alaska through Southeast Asia to Australia and New Zealand.][[0.0]]

[-LSB-edit-RSB- Early years The US Congress laid the groundwork for the establishment of Texas A&M with their proposal of the Morrill Act.][[0.0]]
[The Morrill Act, signed into law July 2, 1862, was created to enable states to establish colleges where the ``leading object shall be, without excluding other scientific and classical studies and including military tactics, to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and mechanical arts...in order to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions in life''.][[0.0]]
[States were granted public lands to be sold at auctions to establish a permanent fund to support the schools.][[0.0]]
[Both the Republic of Texas and the Texas State Legislature also set aside public lands for a future college.][[0.0]]
[The Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, known as Texas A.M.C., was established by the state legislature on April 17, 1871 as the state's first public institution of higher education.][[1.0]]
[The legislature provided US$75,000 for the construction of buildings at the new school, and state leaders invested profits from the sale of 180,000�acres -LRB-730�km2-RRB- received under the Land-Grant College Act in gold frontier defense bonds, creating a permanent endowment for the college.][[0.0]]
[A committee tasked with finding a home for the new college chose Brazos County, which agreed to donate 2,416�acres -LRB-10�km2-RRB- of land.][[0.0]]
[Jefferson Davis, former President of the Confederate States of America, was offered the presidency of the college but turned it down.][[0.0]]
[The college officially opened on October 4, 1876 with six professors.][[1.0]]
[Forty�students were present on the first day of classes, but by the end of the school year the number had grown to 106�students.][[0.0]]
[Only men were admitted, and all students were required to participate in the Corps of Cadets and receive military training.][[1.0]]
[The campus bore minimal resemblance to its modern counterpart.][[0.0]]
[Wild animals roamed freely around the campus, and the area served as a meeting point for the Great Western Cattle Trail.][[0.0]]
[Despite its name, the college taught no classes in agriculture, instead concentrating on classical studies, languages, literature, and applied mathematics.][[0.0]]
[After four years, students could attain degrees in scientific agriculture, civil and mining engineering, and language and literature.][[0.0]]
[Local farmers complained that the college was abusing its mission, and, in November 1879, the president and faculty were replaced and given a mandated curriculum in agriculture and engineering.][[0.0]]
[During these early years, student life was molded by the Corps of Cadets.][[0.0]]
[The Corps was divided into a battalion of three companies, and rivalry among the companies was strong, giving birth to the Aggie spirit and future traditions.][[0.0]]
[No bonfires, yell practices, or athletics teams existed as yet, and social clubs and fraternities were discouraged.][[0.0]]
[Enrollment, which had climbed as high as 500�students, declined to only 80�students in 1883, the year the University of Texas opened in Austin, Texas.][[0.0]]
[Although the Texas Constitution specified that the Agricultural and Mechanical College was to be a branch of a proposed University of Texas, the Austin school was established with a separate Board of Regents.][[0.0]]
[Texas A.M.C. continued to be governed by its own Board of Directors.][[0.0]]
[The two Texas schools quickly began to battle over the limited funds that the state legislature made available for higher education.][[0.0]]
[In 1887, the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station was established at Texas A.M.C., enabling the college to gain more funding.][[0.0]]
[Many residents of the state saw little need for two colleges in Texas, and some wanted to close the agricultural and mechanical school.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Sul Ross era Texas A.M.C. president Lawrence Sullivan Ross, known affectionately to students as ``Sully'', is credited for saving the school from closure and transforming it into a respected military institution.][[0.0]]
[Ross, the immediate past governor of Texas, had been a well-respected Confederate Brigadier General and enjoyed a good reputation among state residents.][[0.0]]
[When Ross arrived at the school, he found no running water, a housing shortage, a disgruntled faculty, and many students running wild.][[0.0]]
[As Ross began to make improvements, parents began to send their children to the school in the hopes that they would learn from Ross's example.][[0.0]]
[Although enrollment had always been limited to men, in 1893, Ethel Hudson, the daughter of an A&M professor, became the first woman to attend classes at the school and helped edit the annual yearbook.][[0.0]]
[She was made an honorary member of the class of 1895.][[0.0]]
[Several years later her twin sisters became honorary members of the class of 1903, and slowly other daughters of Aggie professors were allowed to attend classes.][[0.0]]
[Under Ross's seven and one-half year tenure, many enduring Aggie traditions formed.][[0.0]]
[These traditions include the first Aggie Ring, the first yearbook, and the formation of the Aggie Band.][[0.0]]
[Ross's tenure also saw the school's first intercollegiate football game, played against the University of Texas.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Program expansion By 1910, the school listed eight degree programs, including agriculture, architecture, agricultural engineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and textile engineering.][[0.0]]
[Five years later the state legislature, in cooperation with the United States Department of Agriculture, established the Texas Agricultural Extension Service, organized the Texas Forest Service, and authorized a School of Veterinary Medicine at the college.][[0.0]]
[The college was unprepared for the growth, and for the next ten years several hundred students lived in tents in a field in the middle of campus.][[0.0]]
[During this time, women were also given a more official standing.][[1.0]]
[The Texas Legislature in 1911 refused to give A&M permission to hold a summer semester unless women were also permitted to attend.][[0.0]]
[For the next several decades during the summers cadets were not required to be in uniform and women could attend class and participate in intramural activities.][[0.0]]
[Texas A&M graduates were called to use their military training during World War I, and by 1918, 49% of all graduates of the college were in military service, a larger percentage than any other college or university.][[1.0]]
[In early September 1918, the entire senior class was mustered into military service, with plans to send the younger students at staggered dates throughout the next year.][[0.0]]
[Many of the seniors were fighting in France when the war ended two months later.][[0.0]]
[In total, over 1200 former students served as commissioned officers during World War I.  Texas A&M Hillel, the oldest Hillel organization in the United States, was founded in 1920.][[1.0]]
[The organization occurred three years before the national Hillel Foundation was organized at the University of Illinois.][[0.0]]
[After the war, Texas A&M grew rapidly and became nationally recognized for its programs in agriculture, engineering, and military science.][[0.0]]
[The first graduate school was organized in 1924, and, in 1925, Mary Evelyn Crawford Locke became the first female to receive a diploma from Texas A&M, although she was not allowed to participate in the graduation ceremony.][[0.0]]
[The following month the Board of Directors officially prohibited all women from enrolling.][[0.0]]
[In 1926, they codified that women in summer school had an unofficial status and could not pursue a degree.][[0.0]]
[By 1930, however, over 1800 women had attended classes at A&M.][[0.0]]
[In the late 1920s, following the discovery of oil on university lands, Texas A&M and the University of Texas negotiated a settlement for the division of the Permanent University Fund which enabled A&M to receive one-third of the revenue.][[0.0]]
[This guaranteed wealth enabled A&M to expand.][[0.0]]
[Enrollment increased even during the Great Depression, as student cooperative housing projects enabled the students to attend the school at low costs.][[0.0]]
[During the Depression, as professors were forced to accept a 25% pay cut, the Board of Directors partially rescinded its order against female enrollment, allowing no more than 20 females at a time to enroll in the school, and further restricting the group to daughters of professors.][[0.0]]
[Texas A&M expanded its degree offerings in the late 1930s and awarded its first Ph.D. in 1940.][[0.0]]
[Other programs at the college likewise began offering doctoral degrees throughout the next few decades.][[0.0]]
[World War II gave Texas A&M an opportunity to prove itself on a worldwide stage.][[0.0]]
[The school produced 20,229 fighting men who served in combat; of these, 14,123 were officers, more than the combined total of the United States Naval Academy and the United States Military Academy and more than three times the totals of any other Senior Military College.][[0.0]]
[Seven Aggies received the Medal of Honor during the worldwide conflict, tying with Virginia Tech as the most of any school outside of the military academies at West Point and Annapolis, and 29 former students reached the rank of general.][[0.0]]
[In addition, the college received nationwide exposure during the war when a reporter wrote a widely distributed story about the Aggie Muster on the island of Corregidor.][[0.0]]
[The intense interest resulted in a World War II propaganda movie, We've Never Been Licked, which was filmed on the A&M campus and showcased many of the school traditions.][[0.0]]
[Though Texas A&M was originally established as a branch of the yet-to-be-created University of Texas, subsequent acts of the Texas Legislature never gave the University any authority over Texas A&M.][[1.0]]
[This internal legal conflict in Texas was nullified in 1948 when Texas A&M became the flagship school of the newly created Texas A&M University System, a clear and separate institution from the University of Texas System.][[1.0]]
[A&M's Board of Directors continued to oversee the system.][[0.0]]
[Enrollment soared as many former soldiers used the G.I. Bill to further their education.][[0.0]]
[Unprepared for the growth, between 1949 and 1953 Texas A&M used the former Bryan Air Force Base as an extension of the campus.][[0.0]]
[An estimated 5,500 men lived, studied, ate, showered, and attended classes at the base, which became known as the Annex -LRB-and later as Riverside Campus-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Rudder era The Texas Legislature defeated a nonbinding resolution in the 1950s to encourage A&M to admit women.][[0.0]]
[The school newspaper, The Battalion began writing editorials to encourage coeducation, causing the Student Senate to demand the editor of the paper resign.][[0.0]]
[Later in the year students defeated 2--1 a campus resolution on coeducation.][[0.0]]
[On March 26, 1959 retired Major General James Earl Rudder, who arguably had the most significant effect on the campus, became the 16th president of the college, his alma mater.][[1.0]]
[At the time, the college was still an all-male military school with a 7,500 student enrollment.][[0.0]]
[Within several years of his arrival, the 58th Legislature of Texas officially changed the name of the school from the A&M College of Texas to Texas A&M University.][[1.0]]
[The Legislature specified that in the new name of the school, the A and the M were purely symbolic, reflecting the school's past, and no longer stood for ``Agricultural and Mechanical''.][[0.0]]
[With Rudder's strong encouragement, in 1963, the A&M Board of Directors officially reversed their stance on admitting women.][[0.0]]
[The wives and daughters of faculty, staff and students as well as female staff members were finally allowed to officially participate in undergraduate programs, although they were not permitted to join the Corps of Cadets.][[0.0]]
[The following year the college was officially integrated as A&M welcomed its first African American student.][[0.0]]
[More change ensued, as, in 1965, the Board of Directors voted to make membership in the Corps of Cadets voluntary.][[1.0]]
[The same year the Board voted to allow any woman, not just those connected to students and professors, to attend the university.][[0.0]]
[The Board required that Rudder approve each female applicant; he accepted any woman who met the academic requirements.][[0.0]]
[During Rudder's tenure, African-American students were also welcomed, and in 1967, James L. Courtney of Dallas became the first African-American to receive an undergraduate degree from Texas A&M University.][[0.0]]
[He remained at Texas A&M and, in 1970, became the first African-American to receive a D.V.M. degree from the College of Veterinary Medicine.][[0.0]]
[When Rudder died in 1970, after 11 years as president of the school, Texas A&M University had grown to more than 14,000 students from all 50 states and 75 nations.][[0.0]]
[The school had become coeducational and had even begun construction of an all-female dormitory.][[0.0]]
[The curriculum had been broadened, with upgraded academic and faculty standards, and the school had initiated a multi-million dollar building program.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Recent years On September 17, 1971, Texas A&M University was one of the first four institutions to be designated a sea-grant college in recognition of oceanographic development and research.][[0.0]]
[A third designation was added on August 31, 1989 when Texas A&M was named a space-grant college.][[0.0]]
[The university remains one of few institutions nationwide to hold designations as a land-, sea-, and space-grant college.][[1.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Diversification The Corps welcomed its first female members in the fall of 1974.][[0.0]]
[At the time, the women were segregated into a special unit, known as W-1, and suffered harassment from many of their male counterparts.][[0.0]]
[Women were originally prohibited from serving in leadership positions or in the more elite Corps units such as the band and Ross Volunteers.][[0.0]]
[These groups were opened to female participation in 1988, following a federal court decision in a class-action lawsuit filed by a female cadet.][[0.0]]
[Two years later, in 1990, female-only units were eliminated.][[0.0]]
[In November 1976, the university denied official recognition to the Gay Student Services Organization on the grounds that homosexuality was illegal in Texas, and the group's stated goals--offering referral services and providing educational information to students--were actually the responsibility of university staff.][[0.0]]
[The students sued the university for violation of their First Amendment right to freedom of speech in February 1977.][[0.0]]
[For six years, Gay Student Services v. Texas A&M University wound its way through the courts; although the trial court ruled in favor of Texas A&M several times, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals repeatedly overturned the verdict.][[0.0]]
[The U.S. Supreme Court declined to take the case, letting stand the circuit court ruling that the students' free speech rights had been compromised.][[0.0]]
[The case set a national precedent by removing all legal restrictions against gay rights groups on campuses.][[0.0]]
[The subsequent recognition of the group provided a university precedent for allowing social organizations.][[0.0]]
[In 1977, the university had also denied recognition to Sigma Phi Epsilon, a national social fraternity, because its presence on campus might result in ``a social caste system''.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Presidential library The George Bush Presidential Library was established in 1997 on 90�acres -LRB-364,220�m2-RRB- of land donated by Texas A&M at the western edge of the campus.][[1.0]]
[This tenth presidential library was built between 1995 and 1997 and contains the presidential and vice-presidential papers of George H.W. Bush and the vice-presidential papers of Dan Quayle.][[0.0]]
[To coincide with the opening of the George Bush Presidential Library, Texas A&M established the George Bush School of Government and Public Service.][[0.0]]
[The school, offers a master's degree in public policy and one in international affairs as well as two research degrees, officially launched in 1997.][[0.0]]
[It became a separate school within the university in 1999.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Bonfire collapse At 2:42�a.m. on November 18, 1999, the partially completed Aggie Bonfire, standing 40�feet -LRB-12�m-RRB- tall and consisting of about 5000 logs, collapsed during construction.][[0.0]]
[Of the 58 students and former students working on the stack, 12 were killed and 27 others were injured.][[0.0]]
[The incident received nationwide attention, with over 50 satellite trucks broadcasting from the Texas A&M campus within hours.][[0.0]]
[On November 25, 1999, the date that Bonfire would have burned, Aggies instead held a vigil and remembrance ceremony on site.][[0.0]]
[Over 40,000 people, including former President George H.W. Bush and his wife Barbara and then-Texas governor George W. Bush and his wife Laura, lit candles and observed up to two hours of silence at the site of the Bonfire collapse.][[0.0]]
[A commission put together by Texas A&M University discovered that a number of factors led to the Bonfire collapse, including ``excessive internal stresses'' on the logs and ``inadequate containment strength'', where the wiring used to tie the logs together was not strong enough.][[0.0]]
[The wiring broke after logs from upper tiers were ``wedged'' into lower tiers.][[0.0]]
[Texas A&M officials, Bonfire student leaders, and the university itself were the subject of several lawsuits by parents of the students injured or deceased in the collapse.][[0.0]]
[On May 21, 2004, Federal Judge Samuel B. Kent dismissed all claims against the Texas A&M officials, and, in 2005, 36 of the 64 original defendants, including all of the student leaders, settled their portion of the case for an estimated US$4.25 million, paid by their insurance companies.][[0.0]]
[A federal appeals court dismissed the remaining lawsuits against Texas A&M and its officials in 2007.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Vision 2020 In 1997, university president Ray Bowen appointed a task force to create a new strategic plan for the university.][[0.0]]
[The task force, made up of more than 250 faculty, staff, students, former students, local residents, and various private- and public-sector representatives, devoted more than two years to examining all aspects of the university and studying benchmark institutions before unveiling the plan, dubbed Vision 2020, in 1999.][[0.0]]
[Vision 2020's goal is to make Texas A&M University recognized as a consensus ``top 10'' public university by the year 2020.][[0.0]]
[The plan identifies 12 areas in which the university should focus on improving.][[0.0]]
[Dr. Robert M. Gates succeeded Bowen in 2002, and during his four year tenure as president, Vision 2020's short-term focus narrowed to four key steps:  Gates' leadership resulted in the largest academic expansion in the university's history.][[0.0]]
[As of September 8, 2006, Vision 2020's progress includes:  -LSB-edit-RSB- Hurricane relief Following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Texas A&M opened Reed Arena as a temporary shelter to house over 200 evacuees from New Orleans.][[0.0]]
[Although school was barely in session and there was minimal notice, the students and staff of A&M prepared the facility, setting up several hundred beds on the arena floor and making arrangements for the evacuees to get new clothes and have medical checks.][[0.0]]
[Aggie students organized a child care facility, and Aggie athletes escorted teenagers to the Aggie Rec Center to play basketball.][[0.0]]
[Less than three weeks later, Reed Arena was again opened as a temporary shelter for people fleeing Hurricane Rita.][[0.0]]

[Furthermore, in 2004, the honors organization Phi Beta Kappa opened its 265th chapter at Texas A&M.][[0.0]]
[On December 18, 2006, former Texas A&M University president Robert M. Gates was sworn in as the 22nd U.S. Secretary of Defense.][[0.0]]
[Gates' successor, Elsa Murano, on January 3, 2008 became both the university's first female and first Hispanic president.][[0.0]]
[Murano's term as president ended abruptly June 2009, and was succeeded by Interim President R. Bowen Loftin.][[0.0]]
[Loftin was eventually selected as university president in February of 2010.][[0.0]]
[The university has a current enrollment of more than 45,000, with more than 8,000 graduate and professional students, making it one of the largest universities in America.][[0.0]]
[As of 2007, the percentage of women and men at the school are roughly equal.][[0.0]]

[-LSB-edit-RSB- Life -LSB-edit-RSB- Early years and family Born in 1541, in either the village of Fodele or Candia -LRB-the Venetian name of Chandax, present day Heraklion-RRB- in Crete,-LSB-c-RSB- El Greco was descended from a prosperous urban family, which had probably been driven out of Chania to Candia after an uprising against the Venetians between 1526 and 1528.][[0.0]]
[El Greco's father, Geórgios Theotokópoulos -LRB-d. 1556-RRB-, was a merchant and tax collector.][[0.0]]
[Nothing is known about his mother or his first wife, a Greek woman.][[0.0]]
[El Greco's older brother, Manoússos Theotokópoulos -LRB-1531 -- December 13, 1604-RRB-, was a wealthy merchant and spent the last years of his life -LRB-1603--1604-RRB- in El Greco's Toledo home.][[0.0]]
[El Greco received his initial training as an icon painter of the Cretan school, the leading centre of post-Byzantine art.][[1.0]]
[In addition to painting, he probably studied the classics of ancient Greece, and perhaps the Latin classics also; he left a ``working library'' of 130 books at his death, including the Bible in Greek and an annotated Vasari.][[0.0]]
[Candia was a center for artistic activity where Eastern and Western cultures co-existed harmoniously, where around two hundred painters were active during the 16th century, and had organized a painters' guild, based on the Italian model.][[0.0]]
[In 1563, at the age of twenty-two, El Greco was described in a document as a ``master'' -LRB-``maestro Domenigo''-RRB-, meaning he was already a master of the guild and presumably operating his own workshop.][[1.0]]
[Three years later, in June 1566, as a witness to a contract, he signed his name as μαΐστρος Μένεγος Θεοτοκόπουλος σγουράφος -LRB-Master Menégos Theotokópoulos, painter-RRB-.][[1.0]]
[-LSB-d-RSB- Most scholars believe that the Theotokópoulos ``family was almost certainly Greek Orthodox'', although some Catholic sources still claim him from birth.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-e-RSB- Like many Orthodox emigrants to Europe, he apparently transferred to Catholicism after his arrival, and certainly practiced as a Catholic in Spain, where he described himself as a ``devout Catholic'' in his will.][[0.0]]
[The extensive archival research conducted since the early 1960s by scholars, such as Nikolaos Panayotakis, Pandelis Prevelakis and Maria Constantoudaki, indicates strongly that El Greco's family and ancestors were Greek Orthodox.][[0.0]]
[One of his uncles was an Orthodox priest, and his name is not mentioned in the Catholic archival baptismal records on Crete.][[0.0]]
[Prevelakis goes even further, expressing his doubt that El Greco was ever a practicing Roman Catholic.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Italy It was natural for the young El Greco to pursue his career in Venice, Crete having been a possession of the Republic of Venice since 1211.][[0.0]]
[Though the exact year is not clear, most scholars agree that El Greco went to Venice around 1567.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-f-RSB- Knowledge of El Greco's years in Italy is limited.][[0.0]]
[He lived in Venice until 1570 and, according to a letter written by his much older friend, the greatest miniaturist of the age, the Croatian Giulio Clovio, was a ``disciple'' of Titian, who was by then in his eighties but still vigorous.][[0.0]]
[This may mean he worked in Titian's large studio, or not.][[0.0]]
[Clovio characterized El Greco as ``a rare talent in painting''.][[0.0]]
[In 1570, El Greco moved to Rome, where he executed a series of works strongly marked by his Venetian apprenticeship.][[1.0]]
[It is unknown how long he remained in Rome, though he may have returned to Venice -LRB-c. 1575--1576-RRB- before he left for Spain.][[0.0]]
[In Rome, on the recommendation of Giulio Clovio, El Greco was received as a guest at the Palazzo Farnese, which Cardinal Alessandro Farnese had made a centre of the artistic and intellectual life of the city.][[1.0]]
[There he came into contact with the intellectual elite of the city, including the Roman scholar Fulvio Orsini, whose collection would later include seven paintings by the artist -LRB-View of Mt. Sinai and a portrait of Clovio are among them-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Unlike other Cretan artists who had moved to Venice, El Greco substantially altered his style and sought to distinguish himself by inventing new and unusual interpretations of traditional religious subject matter.][[0.0]]
[His works painted in Italy were influenced by the Venetian Renaissance style of the period, with agile, elongated figures reminiscent of Tintoretto and a chromatic framework that connects him to Titian.][[1.0]]
[The Venetian painters also taught him to organize his multi-figured compositions in landscapes vibrant with atmospheric light.][[0.0]]
[Clovio reports visiting El Greco on a summer's day while the artist was still in Rome.][[0.0]]
[El Greco was sitting in a darkened room, because he found the darkness more conducive to thought than the light of the day, which disturbed his ``inner light''.][[0.0]]
[As a result of his stay in Rome, his works were enriched with elements such as violent perspective vanishing points or strange attitudes struck by the figures with their repeated twisting and turning and tempestuous gestures; all elements of Mannerism.][[0.0]]
[By the time El Greco arrived in Rome, Michelangelo and Raphael were dead, but their example continued to be paramount and left little room for different approaches.][[0.0]]
[Although the artistic heritage of these great masters was overwhelming for young painters, El Greco was determined to make his own mark in Rome defending his personal artistic views, ideas and style.][[0.0]]
[He singled out Correggio and Parmigianino for particular praise, but he did not hesitate to dismiss Michelangelo's Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel;-LSB-g-RSB- he extended an offer to Pope Pius V to paint over the whole work in accord with the new and stricter Catholic thinking.][[0.0]]
[When he was later asked what he thought about Michelangelo, El Greco replied that ``he was a good man, but he did not know how to paint''.][[0.0]]
[And thus we are confronted by a paradox: El Greco is said to have reacted most strongly or even condemned Michelangelo, but he had found it impossible to withstand his influence.][[0.0]]
[Michelangelo's influence can be seen in later El Greco works such as the Allegory of the Holy League.][[0.0]]
[By painting portraits of Michelangelo, Titian, Clovio and, presumably, Raphael in one of his works -LRB-The Purification of the Temple-RRB-, El Greco not only expressed his gratitude but advanced the claim to rival these masters.][[0.0]]
[As his own commentaries indicate, El Greco viewed Titian, Michelangelo and Raphael as models to emulate.][[0.0]]
[In his 17th century Chronicles, Giulio Mancini included El Greco among the painters who had initiated, in various ways, a re-evaluation of Michelangelo's teachings.][[0.0]]
[Because of his unconventional artistic beliefs -LRB-such as his dismissal of Michelangelo's technique-RRB- and personality, El Greco soon acquired enemies in Rome.][[0.0]]
[Architect and writer Pirro Ligorio called him a ``foolish foreigner'', and newly discovered archival material reveals a skirmish with Farnese, who obliged the young artist to leave his palace.][[0.0]]
[On July 6, 1572, El Greco officially complained about this event.][[0.0]]
[A few months later, on September 18, 1572, El Greco paid his dues to the Guild of Saint Luke in Rome as a miniature painter.][[0.0]]
[At the end of that year, El Greco opened his own workshop and hired as assistants the painters Lattanzio Bonastri de Lucignano and Francisco Preboste.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Spain -LSB-edit-RSB- Immigration to Toledo In 1577, El Greco emigrated first to Madrid, then to Toledo, where he produced his mature works.][[1.0]]
[At the time, Toledo was the religious capital of Spain and a populous city-LSB-h-RSB- with ``an illustrious past, a prosperous present and an uncertain future''.][[0.0]]
[In Rome, El Greco had earned the respect of some intellectuals, but was also facing the hostility of certain art critics.][[0.0]]
[During the 1570s the huge monastery-palace of El Escorial was still under construction and Philip II of Spain was experiencing difficulties in finding good artists for the many large paintings required to decorate it.][[0.0]]
[Titian was dead, and Tintoretto, Veronese and Anthonis Mor all refused to come to Spain.][[0.0]]
[Philip had to rely on the lesser talent of Juan Fernándes de Navarrete, whose gravedad y decoro -LRB-``seriousness and decorum''-RRB- the king approved.][[0.0]]
[However, he had just died in 1579; the moment should have been ideal for El Greco.][[0.0]]
[Through Clovio and Orsini, El Greco met Benito Arias Montano, a Spanish humanist and agent of Philip; Pedro Chacón, a clergyman; and Luis de Castilla, son of Diego de Castilla, the dean of the Cathedral of Toledo.][[0.0]]
[El Greco's friendship with Castilla would secure his first large commissions in Toledo.][[0.0]]
[He arrived in Toledo by July 1577, and signed contracts for a group of paintings that was to adorn the church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo in Toledo and for the renowned El Espolio.][[0.0]]
[By September 1579 he had completed nine paintings for Santo Domingo, including The Trinity and The Assumption of the Virgin.][[0.0]]
[These works would establish the painter's reputation in Toledo.][[0.0]]
[El Greco did not plan to settle permanently in Toledo, since his final aim was to win the favor of Philip and make his mark in his court.][[0.0]]
[Indeed, he did manage to secure two important commissions from the monarch: Allegory of the Holy League and Martyrdom of St. Maurice.][[0.0]]
[However, the king did not like these works and placed the St Maurice altarpiece in the chapter-house rather than the intended chapel.][[0.0]]
[He gave no further commissions to El Greco.][[0.0]]
[The exact reasons for the king's dissatisfaction remain unclear.][[0.0]]
[Some scholars have suggested that Philip did not like the inclusion of living persons in a religious scene; some others that El Greco's works violated a basic rule of the Counter-Reformation, namely that in the image the content was paramount rather than the style.][[0.0]]
[Philip took a close interest in his artistic commissions, and had very decided tastes; a long sought-after sculpted Crucifixion by Benvenuto Cellini also failed to please when it arrived, and was likewise exiled to a less prominent place.][[0.0]]
[Philip's next experiment, with Federico Zuccari was even less successful.][[0.0]]
[In any case, Philip's dissatisfaction ended any hopes of royal patronage El Greco may have had.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Mature works and later years Lacking the favor of the king, El Greco was obliged to remain in Toledo, where he had been received in 1577 as a great painter.][[0.0]]
[According to Hortensio Félix Paravicino, a 17th-century Spanish preacher and poet, ``Crete gave him life and the painter's craft, Toledo a better homeland, where through Death he began to achieve eternal life.''][[0.0]]
[In 1585, he appears to have hired an assistant, Italian painter Francisco Preboste, and to have established a workshop capable of producing altar frames and statues as well as paintings.][[0.0]]
[On March 12, 1586 he obtained the commission for The Burial of the Count of Orgaz, now his best-known work.][[0.0]]
[The decade 1597 to 1607 was a period of intense activity for El Greco.][[0.0]]
[During these years he received several major commissions, and his workshop created pictorial and sculptural ensembles for a variety of religious institutions.][[0.0]]
[Among his major commissions of this period were three altars for the Chapel of San José in Toledo -LRB-1597--1599-RRB-; three paintings -LRB-1596--1600-RRB- for the Colegio de Doña María de Aragon, an Augustinian monastery in Madrid, and the high altar, four lateral altars, and the painting St. Ildefonso for the Capilla Mayor of the Hospital de la Caridad -LRB-Hospital of Charity-RRB- at Illescas -LRB-1603--1605-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[The minutes of the commission of The Virgin of the Immaculate Conception -LRB-1607--1613-RRB-, which were composed by the personnel of the municipality, describe El Greco as ``one of the greatest men in both this kingdom and outside it''.][[0.0]]
[Between 1607 and 1608 El Greco was involved in a protracted legal dispute with the authorities of the Hospital of Charity at Illescas concerning payment for his work, which included painting, sculpture and architecture;-LSB-i-RSB- this and other legal disputes contributed to the economic difficulties he experienced towards the end of his life.][[0.0]]
[In 1608, he received his last major commission: for the Hospital of Saint John the Baptist in Toledo.][[0.0]]
[El Greco made Toledo his home.][[0.0]]
[Surviving contracts mention him as the tenant from 1585 onwards of a complex consisting of three apartments and twenty-four rooms which belonged to the Marquis de Villena.][[0.0]]
[It was in these apartments, which also served as his workshop, that he passed the rest of his life, painting and studying.][[0.0]]
[He lived in considerable style, sometimes employing musicians to play whilst he dined.][[0.0]]
[It is not confirmed whether he lived with his Spanish female companion, Jerónima de Las Cuevas, whom he probably never married.][[0.0]]
[She was the mother of his only son, Jorge Manuel, born in 1578, who also became a painter, assisted his father, and continued to repeat his compositions for many years after he inherited the studio.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-j-RSB- In 1604, Jorge Manuel and Alfonsa de los Morales gave birth to El Greco's grandson, Gabriel, who was baptized by Gregorio Angulo, governor of Toledo and a personal friend of the artist.][[0.0]]
[During the course of the execution of a commission for the Hospital Tavera, El Greco fell seriously ill, and a month later, on April 7, 1614, he died.][[1.0]]
[A few days earlier, on March 31, he had directed that his son should have the power to make his will.][[0.0]]
[Two Greeks, friends of the painter, witnessed this last will and testament -LRB-El Greco never lost touch with his Greek origins-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[He was buried in the Church of Santo Domingo el Antigua, aged 73.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Art -LSB-edit-RSB- Technique and style The primacy of imagination and intuition over the subjective character of creation was a fundamental principle of El Greco's style.][[0.0]]
[El Greco discarded classicist criteria such as measure and proportion.][[0.0]]
[He believed that grace is the supreme quest of art, but the painter achieves grace only if he manages to solve the most complex problems with obvious ease.][[0.0]]
[El Greco regarded color as the most important and the most ungovernable element of painting, and declared that color had primacy over form.][[0.0]]
[Francisco Pacheco, a painter and theoretician who visited El Greco in 1611, wrote that the painter liked ``the colors crude and unmixed in great blots as a boastful display of his dexterity'' and that ``he believed in constant repainting and retouching in order to make the broad masses tell flat as in nature''.][[0.0]]
[Art historian Max Dvořák was the first scholar to connect El Greco's art with Mannerism and Antinaturalism.][[0.0]]
[Modern scholars characterize El Greco's theory as ``typically Mannerist'' and pinpoint its sources in the Neoplatonism of the Renaissance.][[0.0]]
[Jonathan Brown believes that El Greco endeavored to create a sophisticated form of art; according to Nicholas Penny ``once in Spain, El Greco was able to create a style of his own -- one that disavowed most of the descriptive ambitions of painting''.][[0.0]]
[In his mature works El Greco demonstrated a characteristic tendency to dramatize rather than to describe.][[0.0]]
[The strong spiritual emotion transfers from painting directly to the audience.][[0.0]]
[According to Pacheco, El Greco's perturbed, violent and at times seemingly careless-in-execution art was due to a studied effort to acquire a freedom of style.][[0.0]]
[El Greco's preference for exceptionally tall and slender figures and elongated compositions, which served both his expressive purposes and aesthetic principles, led him to disregard the laws of nature and elongate his compositions to ever greater extents, particularly when they were destined for altarpieces.][[0.0]]
[The anatomy of the human body becomes even more otherworldly in El Greco's mature works; for The Virgin of the Immaculate Conception El Greco asked to lengthen the altarpiece itself by another 1.5�feet -LRB-0.46�m-RRB- ``because in this way the form will be perfect and not reduced, which is the worst thing that can happen to a figure'''.][[0.0]]
[A significant innovation of El Greco's mature works is the interweaving between form and space; a reciprocal relationship is developed between the two which completely unifies the painting surface.][[0.0]]
[This interweaving would re-emerge three centuries later in the works of Cézanne and Picasso.][[0.0]]
[Another characteristic of El Greco's mature style is the use of light.][[0.0]]
[As Jonathan Brown notes, ``each figure seems to carry its own light within or reflects the light that emanates from an unseen source''.][[0.0]]
[Fernando Marias and Agustín Bustamante García, the scholars who transcribed El Greco's handwritten notes, connect the power that the painter gives to light with the ideas underlying Christian Neo-Platonism.][[0.0]]
[Modern scholarly research emphasizes the importance of Toledo for the complete development of El Greco's mature style and stresses the painter's ability to adjust his style in accordance with his surroundings.][[0.0]]
[Harold Wethey asserts that ``although Greek by descent and Italian by artistic preparation, the artist became so immersed in the religious environment of Spain that he became the most vital visual representative of Spanish mysticism''.][[0.0]]
[He believes that in El Greco's mature works ``the devotional intensity of mood reflects the religious spirit of Roman Catholic Spain in the period of the Counter-Reformation''.][[0.0]]
[El Greco also excelled as a portraitist, able not only to record a sitter's features but also to convey their character.][[0.0]]
[His portraits are fewer in number than his religious paintings, but are of equally high quality.][[0.0]]
[Wethey says that ``by such simple means, the artist created a memorable characterization that places him in the highest rank as a portraitist, along with Titian and Rembrandt''.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Suggested Byzantine affinities Since the beginning of the 20th century, scholars have debated whether El Greco's style had Byzantine origins.][[1.0]]
[Certain art historians had asserted that El Greco's roots were firmly in the Byzantine tradition, and that his most individual characteristics derive directly from the art of his ancestors, while others had argued that Byzantine art could not be related to El Greco's later work.][[0.0]]
[The discovery of the Dormition of the Virgin on Syros, an authentic and signed work from the painter's Cretan period, and the extensive archival research in the early 1960s, contributed to the rekindling and reassessment of these theories.][[0.0]]
[Although following many conventions of the Byzantine icon, aspects of the style certainly show Venetian influence, and the composition, showing the death of Mary, combines the different doctrines of the Orthodox Dormition of the Virgin and the Catholic Assumption of the Virgin.][[0.0]]
[Significant scholarly works of the second half of the 20th century devoted to El Greco reappraise many of the interpretations of his work, including his supposed Byzantinism.][[0.0]]
[Based on the notes written in El Greco's own hand, on his unique style, and on the fact that El Greco signed his name in Greek characters, they see an organic continuity between Byzantine painting and his art.][[0.0]]
[According to Marina Lambraki-Plaka ``far from the influence of Italy, in a neutral place which was intellectually similar to his birthplace, Candia, the Byzantine elements of his education emerged and played a catalytic role in the new conception of the image which is presented to us in his mature work''.][[0.0]]
[In making this judgement, Lambraki-Plaka disagrees with Oxford University professors Cyril Mango and Elizabeth Jeffreys, who assert that ``despite claims to the contrary, the only Byzantine element of his famous paintings was his signature in Greek lettering''.][[0.0]]
[Nikos Hadjinikolaou states that from 1570 El Greco's painting is ``neither Byzantine nor post-Byzantine but Western European.][[0.0]]
[The works he produced in Italy belong to the history of the Italian art, and those he produced in Spain to the history of Spanish art''.][[0.0]]
[The English art historian David Davies seeks the roots of El Greco's style in the intellectual sources of his Greek-Christian education and in the world of his recollections from the liturgical and ceremonial aspect of the Orthodox Church.][[0.0]]

[He asserts that the philosophies of Platonism and ancient Neo-Platonism, the works of Plotinus and Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, the texts of the Church fathers and the liturgy offer the keys to the understanding of El Greco's style.][[0.0]]
[Summarizing the ensuing scholarly debate on this issue, José Álvarez Lopera, curator at the Museo del Prado, Madrid, concludes that the presence of ``Byzantine memories'' is obvious in El Greco's mature works, though there are still some obscure issues concerning his Byzantine origins needing further illumination.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Architecture and sculpture El Greco was highly esteemed as an architect and sculptor during his lifetime.][[0.0]]

[Pacheco characterized him as ``a writer of painting, sculpture and architecture''.][[0.0]]
[In the marginalia that El Greco inscribed in his copy of Daniele Barbaro's translation of Vitruvius' De architectura, he refuted Vitruvius' attachment to archaeological remains, canonical proportions, perspective and mathematics.][[0.0]]
[He also saw Vitruvius' manner of distorting proportions in order to compensate for distance from the eye as responsible for creating monstrous forms.][[0.0]]
[El Greco was averse to the very idea of rules in architecture; he believed above all in the freedom of invention and defended novelty, variety, and complexity.][[0.0]]
[These ideas were, however, far too extreme for the architectural circles of his era and had no immediate resonance.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Legacy -LSB-edit-RSB- Posthumous critical reputation El Greco was disdained by the immediate generations after his death because his work was opposed in many respects to the principles of the early baroque style which came to the fore near the beginning of the 17th century and soon supplanted the last surviving traits of the 16th-century Mannerism.][[0.0]]

[In El Greco's work, Meier-Graefe found foreshadowing of modernity.][[0.0]]
[These are the words Meier-Graefe used to describe El Greco's impact on the artistic movements of his time: To the English artist and critic Roger Fry in 1920, El Greco was the archetypal genius who did as he thought best ``with complete indifference to what effect the right expression might have on the public''.][[1.0]]

[During the same period, other researchers developed alternate, more radical theories.][[0.0]]
[The physicians August Goldschmidt and Germán Beritens argued that El Greco painted such elongated human figures because he had vision problems -LRB-possibly progressive astigmatism or strabismus-RRB- that made him see bodies longer than they were, and at an angle to the perpendicular;-LSB-l-RSB- the physician Arturo Perera, however, attributed this style to the use of marijuana.][[0.0]]

[In 1937, a highly influential study by art historian Rodolfo Pallucchini had the effect of greatly increasing the number of works accepted to be by El Greco.][[0.0]]
[Pallucchini attributed to El Greco a small triptych in the Galleria Estense at Modena on the basis of a signature on the painting on the back of the central panel on the Modena triptych -LRB-``Χείρ Δομήνιχου'', Created by the hand of Doménikos-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[There was consensus that the triptych was indeed an early work of El Greco and, therefore, Pallucchini's publication became the yardstick for attributions to the artist.][[0.0]]
[Nevertheless, Wethey denied that the Modena triptych had any connection at all with the artist and, in 1962, produced a reactive catalogue raisonné with a greatly reduced corpus of materials.][[0.0]]
[Whereas art historian José Camón Aznar had attributed between 787 and 829 paintings to the Cretan master, Wethey reduced the number to 285 authentic works and Halldor Sœhner, a German researcher of Spanish art, recognized only 137.][[0.0]]
[Wethey and other scholars rejected the notion that Crete took any part in his formation and supported the elimination of a series of works from El Greco's oeuvre.][[0.0]]
[Since 1962, the discovery of the Dormition and the extensive archival research has gradually convinced scholars that Wethey's assessments were not entirely correct, and that his catalogue decisions may have distorted the perception of the whole nature of El Greco's origins, development and oeuvre.][[0.0]]
[The discovery of the Dormition led to the attribution of three other signed works of ``Doménicos'' to El Greco -LRB-Modena Triptych, St. Luke Painting the Virgin and Child, and The Adoration of the Magi-RRB- and then to the acceptance of more works as authentic -- some signed, some not -LRB-such as The Passion of Christ -LRB-Pietà with Angels-RRB- painted in 1566-RRB-, -- which were brought into the group of early works of El Greco.][[0.0]]

Document 23 133
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Background Christopher Smart was an English poet who was confined to asylums during a time of debate about the nature of madness and its treatment.][[1.0]]
[During the 18th century, madness was ``both held to reveal inner truth and condemned to silence and exclusion as something unintelligible by reason, and therefore threatening to society and to humanity''.][[0.0]]
[It was commonly held to be an incurable affliction whose sufferers should be isolated from society.][[0.0]]
[Physician William Battie--who later treated Smart--wrote: In particular, Battie defined madness as ``deluded imagination''.][[0.0]]
[However, he was attacked by other physicians, such as John Monro, who worked at Bethlem Hospital.][[0.0]]
[In his Remarks on Dr. Battie's Treatise on Madness, Monro explained that those who were mad had the correct perceptions, but that they lacked the ability to judge properly.][[0.0]]
[Although Monro promoted ideas of reform, his suggested treatment--beating patients--was as harsh on patients as Battie's preferred option, of completely isolating patients from society.][[0.0]]
[In 1758, Battie and others argued that those deemed ``mad'' were abused under the British asylum system, and they pushed for parliamentary action.][[0.0]]
[Battie's Treatise on Madness emphasised the problems of treating the hospitals as tourist attractions and the punitive measures taken against patients.][[0.0]]
[The arguments of Battie and others resulted in the passage of the Act for Regulating Private Madhouses -LRB-1774-RRB-, but were too late to help Smart.][[0.0]]
[Modern critics, however, have a more cynical view of the 18th-century use of the term ``madness'' when diagnosing patients; psychiatrist Thomas Szasz viewed the idea of madness as arbitrary and unnatural.][[0.0]]
[Agreeing with Szasz's position, philosopher Michel Foucault emphasised that asylums were used in the 18th century to attack dissenting views and that the idea of madness was a cultural fear held by the British public, rather than a legitimate medical condition.][[0.0]]
[In particular, Foucault considered the 18th century a time of ``great confinement''.][[0.0]]
[This description is consistent with Smart's 1760s writings on the subject in which, according to Thomas Keymer, ``the category of madness is insistently relativized, and made to seem little more than the invention of a society strategically concerned to discredit all utterances or conduct that threatens its interests and norms.''][[0.0]]
[18th century treatment of inpatients was simple: they were to be fed daily a light diet of bread, oatmeal, some meat or cheese, and a little amount of beer, which were inadequate in meeting daily nutritional needs; they were denied contact without outsiders, including family members; and they would be denied access to that which was deemed to be the cause of their madness -LRB-these causes ranged from alcohol and food to working outside-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[If their actions appeared ``afresh and without assignable cause'', then their condition would be labelled as ``original'' madness and deemed incurable.][[0.0]]
[An institution like St Luke's, run by Battie, held both ``curable'' and ``incurable'' patients.][[0.0]]
[There were few spots available for patients to receive free treatment, and many were released after a year to make room for new admittances.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Asylum During the 1740s, Smart published many poems while a student at Pembroke College, Cambridge.][[0.0]]
[He eventually left the school in 1749 in order to devote his time to poetry.][[0.0]]
[In 1750, Smart started to familiarize himself with Grub Street, London's writing district, and met John Newbery, a publisher.][[0.0]]
[Soon after, Newbery began publishing Smart's works in various magazines and in collections, including Poems on Several Occasions -LRB-1752-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Of these works, Smart was known for his Seatonian Prize-winning poems, his pastoral poem The Hop-Garden, and his mock epic The Hilliad.][[0.0]]
[In 1752, Smart married Newbery's daughter, Anna Maria Carnan, and had two daughters with her by 1754.][[0.0]]
[Although many of Smart's works were published between 1753 and 1755, he had little money to provide for his family.][[0.0]]
[At the end of 1755, he finished a translation of the works of Horace, but even that provided little income.][[0.0]]
[Having no other choices, Smart signed a 99-year long contract in November 1755 to produce a weekly paper entitled The Universal Visiter or Monthly Memorialist, and the strain of writing caused Smart's health to deteriorate.][[0.0]]
[On 5 June 1756, Smart's father-in-law Newbery published, without permission, Smart's Hymn to the Supreme Being, a poem which thanked God for recovery from an illness of some kind, possibly a ``disturbed mental state''.][[0.0]]
[During the illness, Smart was possibly confined to Newbery's home and unable to write or be socially active.][[0.0]]
[Out of sympathy for Smart, many of his friends, including writer and critic Samuel Johnson, began to write in the Universal Visiter to fulfill Smart's contractual obligation to produce content for the magazine.][[0.0]]
[The publication of Hymn to the Supreme Being marked the beginning of Smart's obsession with religion and eventual confinement for madness because he began praying ``without ceasing''.][[0.0]]
[Smart's behaviour was probably influenced by St Paul's command in the First Epistle to the Thessalonians to ``Pray without ceasing'' and William Law's The Spirit of Prayer, which argues that a constant state of prayer will establish a connection with God.][[0.0]]
[Smart began by praying at regular intervals but this slowly deteriorated into irregular praying in which he would interrupt his friends' activities and call them into the street to pray with him.][[0.0]]
[These calls for public prayer continued until an incident that Smart later described in Jubilate Agno: ``For I blessed God in St James's Park till I routed all the company... For the officers of the peace are at variance with me, and the watchman smites me with his staff'' -LRB-Jubilate Agno B 90--91-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Christopher Hunter, Smart's biographer and nephew, described the situation: Hunter reports that Samuel Johnson visited Smart during the latter's confinement, and it was Johnson that, ``on the first approaches of Mr Smart's malady, wrote several papers for a periodical publication in which that gentleman was concerned.''][[0.0]]
[However, at no time did Smart ever believe himself to be insane; these meetings began before Smart was ever put into asylum because he still contributed, although not as significantly, to the Universal Visiter.][[0.0]]
[In joking about writing for the Universal Visiter, Johnson claimed: ``for poor Smart, while he was mad, not then knowing the terms on which he was engaged to write�... I hoped his wits would return to him.][[0.0]]
[Mine returned to me, and I wrote in `the Universal Visitor' no longer.''][[0.0]]
[There are other possibilities beyond madness or religious fervor that may have led to Smart's confinement: Newbery may have used the imprisonment of his son-in-law as leverage to control the publication of Smart's work and as a warning to others who worked for him not to cross him.][[0.0]]
[Another theory suggests Smart's actions were a result of alcohol, and had nothing to do with a mental imbalance.][[0.0]]
[However, Smart may have been imprisoned for embarrassing his father-in-law in some way, which could have resulted from an incident in which Smart drank.][[0.0]]
[Hester Thrale reinforced this latter possibility when she claimed that Smart's ``religious fervor'' tended to coincide with times that Smart was intoxicated.][[0.0]]
[Smart's own testimony that he ``blessed God in St. James's Park till I routed all the company'' -LRB-Jubilate Agno B 90--91-RRB- as representing his religious madness is equally dismissed as resulting from drinking, as he was known for pulling pranks and the Board of the Green Cloth, the government body that controlled St James's Park, would treat most disturbances in the park as resulting from madness.][[0.0]]
[If Smart was placed into the asylum as a result of actions at St James's, he would not have been the only one, since records show that the Board of the Green Cloth was responsible for admitting sixteen people to Bethlem Hospital for ``frenzy'' at St James's Park during the century prior to Smart being placed in St Luke's.][[0.0]]
[The specific events of Smart's confinement are unknown.][[0.0]]
[He may have been in a private madhouse before St Luke's and later moved from St Luke's to Mr Potter's asylum until his release.][[1.0]]
[At St Luke's, he transitioned from being ``curable'' to ``incurable'', and was moved to Mr Potter's asylum for monetary reasons.][[1.0]]
[During Smart's confinement time, his wife Anna left and took the children with her to Ireland.][[0.0]]
[There is no record that he ever saw her again.][[0.0]]
[His isolation led him into writing religious poetry, and he abandoned the traditional genres of the 18th century that marked his earlier poetry when he wrote Jubilate Agno.][[1.0]]
[During his time in asylum, Smart busied himself with a daily ritual of writing poetry; these lyric fragments eventually formed his Jubilate Agno and A Song to David.][[1.0]]
[Smart might have turned to writing poetry as a way to focus the mind or as self-therapy.][[0.0]]
[Although 20th-century critics debate whether his new poetic self-examination represents an expression of evangelical Christianity, his poetry during his isolation does show a desire for ``unmediated revelation'' from God.][[1.0]]
[There is an ``inner light'' that serves as a focal point for Smart and his poems written during his confinement, and that inner light connects him to the Christian God.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- St Luke's Hospital for Lunatics Few details are known about Smart's time at St Luke's Hospital for Lunatics.][[0.0]]
[He was admitted to St Luke's on 6 May 1757 as a ``Curable Patient''.][[0.0]]
[It is possible that Smart was confined at Newbery's behest over old debts and a poor relationship that existed between the two; Newbery had previously mocked Smart's immorality in A Collection of Pretty Poems for the Amusement of Children six Foot High.][[0.0]]
[Regardless of Newbery's exact reasons, there is evidence suggesting that Newbery's admittance of Smart into the mental asylum was not based on madness.][[0.0]]
[In order to have Smart admitted, Newbery probably provided a small bribe, although bribes were against St Luke's policy.][[0.0]]
[There is little information about Smart's condition during his stay at St Luke's, possibly because Battie's denied his patients from being visited, including by their own family members.][[0.0]]
[One of the few records that survive of Smart's time at St Luke's was an entry in St Luke's Minute Book, which read: During Smart's confinement at St Luke's, not even other doctors were allowed to see Smart unless they had received personal permission from Battie.][[0.0]]
[It was improbable that Smart could have left the asylum without being released by Battie.][[0.0]]
[Even if Smart would have attempted to obtain release via legal means, the rules for subpoenaing release would have been almost impossible to follow based on the system that Battie had in place, which isolated the individual from all contact.][[0.0]]
[Eventually, Smart was deemed ``incurable'' and would not have been released by the hospital but for its lack of funds.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Mr Potter's madhouse After being released from St Luke's, Smart was taken to a private madhouse.][[0.0]]
[Elizabeth LeNoir, Smart's daughter, was brought to see her father and stated that he was ``committed by Mr Newbery to the care of a Mr Potter who kept a private house at Bethnal Green''.][[0.0]]
[She described her experience as being held in a ``small neat parlour''.][[0.0]]
[However, Mr Potter's private madhouse was not ``homely'', and Smart's treatments were far worse, as he describes: ``For they work on me with their harping-irons, which is a barbarous instrument, because I am more unguarded than others'' -LRB-Jubilate Agno B 129-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Smart was left alone for four years, except for his cat Jeoffry and the occasional gawker who would come to see those deemed mad.][[0.0]]
[Piozzi described Smart's general situation: ``He was both a wit and a scholar, and visited as such while under confinement for MADNESS.''][[0.0]]
[It is very possible that he felt ``homeless'' during his confinement and surely felt that he was in a ``limbo... between public and private space'' from being watched by outsiders.][[0.0]]
[In London, only a few of his works were still being published, but the proceeds were taken by Newbery.][[0.0]]
[However, Smart did get to see published a collection of his work under the pseudonym ``Mrs Midnight'' titled Mrs. Midnight's Orations; and other Select Pieces: as they were spoken at the Oratory in the Hay-Market, London.][[0.0]]
[Smart did not profit from the work, but he was able to see at least some of his previous work being printed again.][[0.0]]
[Smart, according to his 20th-century biographer Arthur Sherbo, had only ``his God and his poetry''.][[0.0]]
[A few of his loyal friends eventually grew tired of the treatment Smart received and freed him from Mr Potter's.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Release There is little information about how and why Smart was released from asylum, but his daughter claimed: ``He grew better, and some misjudging friends who misconstrued Mr Newbery's great kindness in placing him under necessary & salutary restriction which might possibly have eventually wrought a cure, invited him to dinner and he returned to his confinement no more.''][[0.0]]
[What is known about the actual events is that John Sherratt, Christopher Smart's friend, believed that Smart's confinement was unfair and wanted to negotiate Smart's release.][[0.0]]
[In January 1763, he met with a parliamentary committee to discuss the issue of individuals falsely imprisoned and abuses that they would receive in asylums.][[0.0]]
[In particular, Sherratt argued that many were admitted for habitual intoxication, which undermined Battie's and other asylum keeper's reputations.][[0.0]]
[A finding by the parliamentary committee released 27 January 1763 bolstered Sherratt's chances to release Smart.][[0.0]]
[To those around him, Smart appeared perfectly sane, and he was most likely released because of legislation concurrently being passed in parliament advocating for a reform to patient care.][[0.0]]
[Smart left the asylum on 30 January 1763 with Sherratt.][[0.0]]
[Upon leaving asylum, Smart took the manuscripts of A Song to David, many translations of Psalms, and Jubilate Agno.][[0.0]]
[A Song to David was published on 6 April 1763.][[0.0]]
[Harsh reviews followed which mocked Smart's time in the asylum instead of dealing with the poems.][[0.0]]
[Jubilate Agno stayed in manuscript form and passed into the hands of the friends of William Cowper, a poet also placed into asylum and Smart's contemporary, when they investigated the concept of ``madness''.][[0.0]]
[The work stayed in private holdings until it was rediscovered in the 20th century by William Stead.][[0.0]]
[It was not published until 1939 when it was printed with the title Rejoice in the Lamb: A Song from Bedlam.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Analysis Samuel Johnson's biographer James Boswell described a moment when Charles Burney inquired of his friend Johnson of Smart's state.][[0.0]]
[Johnson used the term ``madness'' to comment on the state of society before explaining to Burney that Smart's actions that were deemed symptoms of madness were actually reasonable: In an article printed in the Gentleman's Magazine, Hester Piozzi, Smart's acquaintance and Johnson's close friend, argued that in many aspects Smart appears sane: Beyond Smart's circle of friends, few were willing to dismiss claims that Smart was affected by madness.][[1.0]]
[Most contemporary literary critics knew of Smart's time in asylum and, upon publication of his A Song to David, called attention to aspects of the poem which they could use to claim that Smart was still ``mad''.][[0.0]]
[The view was widely held, and the poet William Mason wrote to Thomas Gray, ``I have seen his Song to David & from thence conclude him as mad as ever.''][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- 19th century It was a century before a positive twist was put on Christopher Smart's time in asylum; the Victorian poet Robert Browning argued that A Song to David was great because Smart was mad at the time.][[1.0]]
[In his poem Parleyings -LRB-1887-RRB-, Browning claimed: To Browning, Smart's temporary madness was what allowed A Song to David to compose poetry similar to that of John Milton and John Keats.][[0.0]]
[Christopher Smart, as Browning's poem continued, Browning's remarks brought about a later appreciation of A Song to David and Smart's madness.][[0.0]]
[A review of Browning's Parleying claimed that Christopher Smart was ``possessed by his subject... and where there is true possession -- where the fires of the poet's imagination are not choked by self-consciousness or by too much fuel from the intellect -- idiosyncracy, mannerism, and even conventional formulae are for the time `burnt and purged away'.''][[0.0]]
[The 19th-century poet Dante Gabriel Rossetti emphasised the benefits of Smart's madness and claimed that A Song to David was ``the only great accomplished poem of the last century.''][[0.0]]
[Two years later, Francis Palgrave continued the theme when he wrote that the Song exhibited ``noble wildness and transitions from grandeur to tenderness, from Earth to Heaven'' and that it was ``unique in our Poetry.''][[1.0]]
[Seven years after Palgrave, critic John Churton Collins agreed with Rosetti and Palgrave, but to a lesser extent, when he wrote, ``This poem stands alone, the most extraordinary phenomenon, perhaps, in our literature, the one rapt strain in the poetry of the eighteenth century, the work of a poet who, though he produced much, has not produced elsewhere a single line which indicates the power here displayed.''][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- 20th century and contemporary The 20th-century view among critics favoured that Smart suffered from some kind of mental distress when writing his poems.][[0.0]]
[A review by ``Mathews'' titled ``Thin Partitions'', in the 30 March 1901 The Academy, claimed that: In 1933, A. E. Housman sided with Browning's and Mathew's interpretation and connected Smart's madness with poetic genius in his lecture The Name and Nature of Poetry: ``As matters actually stand, who are the English poets of that age in whom pre-eminently one can hear and recognize the true poetic accent emerging clearly from the contemporary dialect?][[0.0]]
[These four: Collins, Christopher Smart, Cowper, and Blake.][[0.0]]
[And what other characteristic had these four in common?][[0.0]]
[In 1994, Branimir Rieger differed from Housman's view by distancing Smart from the others when he argued that ``Collins and Cowper pine as isolated individuals, guiltily aware of a vitality that is not finally human but divine.][[0.0]]
[Smart soars beyond individuality to embrace that vitality, but at a cost of all human relationship.''][[0.0]]
[However, there are many that disagreed that Smart suffered from madness; Edward Ainsworth and Charles Noyes, when discussing Smart's Hymn to the Supreme Being, said, ``The mind that composed this hymn was not deranged.][[0.0]]
[Yet in the poem one sees the morbidly religious mind which, in disorder, was to produce the Jubilate Agno, and, with order restored, the Song to David.][[0.0]]
[Additionally, they claimed that Smart's Nevertheless, Ainsworth and Noyes were not completely skeptical about Smart's diagnosis when they continued: ``But when the desire to pray struck him, Smart abandoned what the world chose to call rationality.''][[0.0]]
[In 1960, psychiatrist Russel Brain diagnosed Smart as suffering from cyclothymia or manic depression.][[0.0]]
[Brain based his diagnosis on Smart's own claims about how he felt, and he concluded that ``in Smart's case the mental illness was not the result of his drunkenness, but he drank because he was mentally unstable.''][[0.0]]
[Arthur Sherbo, in 1967, argued that ``The nature of Smart's madness is impossible to diagnose at this distance in time'' and then argued that: The possible religious component of Smart's condition was taken up by 20th-century critics as an explanation for why the 18th century saw Smart as mad.][[1.0]]
[Laurence Binyon, in 1934, believed that religion played a major role in how society viewed Smart: ``Smart's madness seems to have taken the form of a literal interpretation of the injunction Pray without ceasing.][[0.0]]
[He embarrassed visitors by insisting on their joining him in his supplications -LSB-...-RSB- Obsession with a fixed idea is a common form of insanity.][[0.0]]
[But such obsessions are a mental imprisonment; whereas the Song is unmistakably the expression of a great release.''][[0.0]]
[Binyon's idea was picked up by Sophia Blaydes, in 1966, who pointed out that society was prejudiced against those who experienced enthusiasm, a strong spiritual connection to God.][[0.0]]
[It was against religious prejudice that she argued, In the 18th century, as Blaydes continued, the word changed from possessed by god to inspired to falsely inspired.][[0.0]]
[The result of this change was that British society viewed enthusiasm as the enemy to both reason and social order.][[0.0]]
[Thus, ``Smart, the hack-writer, would not have been greeted by a hostile audience, but Smart, the enthusiast, would have been condemned immediately.][[0.0]]
[The result would be obvious: his past work, previously lauded, would be ignored, and his future work would receive immediate condemnation.][[0.0]]
[such was the history of Smart's contemporary reputation.''][[0.0]]
[In determining if Smart was really mad or not, Blaydes concluded, ``in Smart's day, any sign of enthusiasm would have been cause for the judgment of madness -LSB-...-RSB- Two accounts of Smart and the nature of his madness have been preserved for us.][[0.0]]
[Each permits some doubt that the poet was mad and could be regarded so in any age.''][[0.0]]
[Frances Anderson, in 1974 characterized Smart's ``illness'' as insanity and obsession, but believed that ``Smart's madness consisted of his efforts to obey literally St Paul's injunction to the Thessalonians: `Pray without ceasing.'''][[0.0]]
[During his episodes of illness, as Anderson continued, Smart ``probably suffered some periods of delirium'' but also ``appeared to know what he was doing''.][[0.0]]
[Smart's actions were similar to 18th-century Methodists that were ``addicted to public prayer with what was thought to be overly charged high spirits.][[0.0]]
[Such displayers of religious emotionalism were often confined not only to private madhouses, but also to Bedlam''.][[0.0]]
[Later in 1998, Charles Rosen pointed out that ``The Enlightenment condemned religious enthusiasm as appropriate for the uneducated and the great unwashed'' and ``it is understandable that the only original and vital religious poetry between 1760 and 1840 should have been written by poets considered genuinely mad by their contemporaries: Smart, Blake, and Hölderlin.''][[0.0]]
[Accounts at the end of the 20th century focused on the effects of Smart's confinement.][[0.0]]
[Clement Hawes, following Michel Foucault's interpretation of the 18th century that there was an ''`animality' of madness'', believed that Smart emotionally connected with animals because of the ``medical stigmatization'' he felt at the hands of his fellow man.][[0.0]]
[Chris Mounsey, agreeing with Hawes's interpretation, believed that Smart's treatment was ``a bestializing process and had taught him to hold his tongue and sit out his time as quietly as possible.''][[0.0]]
[Contrary to the bestialization, Allan Ingram argued that Jubilate Agno was ``a poetic phenomenon that would have demolished contemporary poetic orthodoxies had it been publishable.][[0.0]]

[-LSB-edit-RSB- Bruges After the German Army captured much of Belgium following the battle of the Frontiers in 1914, the Allied forces were left holding a thin strip of coastline to the west of the Yser.][[1.0]]
[The remainder of the Belgian coast came under the occupation of German Marine Divisions, including the important strategic ports of Antwerp and Bruges.][[1.0]]
[Whilst Antwerp was a deep water port vulnerable to British attack from the sea, Bruges, sitting six miles -LRB-10 km-RRB- inland, was comparatively safe from naval bombardment or coastal raids.][[1.0]]
[A network of canals connected Bruges with the coast at Ostend and Zeebrugge, through which small warships such as destroyers, light cruisers and submarines could travel and find a safe harbour from which to launch raids into the English Channel and along the coasts of South-East England.][[1.0]]
[U-boats could also depart from Bruges at night, cutting a day off the journey to the Western Approaches, more easily avoiding the North Sea Mine Barrage and allowing U-boat captains to gain familiarity with the net and mine defences of the English Channel, through which they had to pass to reach the main battlegrounds of the Atlantic.][[0.0]]
[During 1915 and 1916, the German Navy had developed Bruges from a small Flanders port into a major naval centre with large concrete bunkers for U-boats to shelter from nightly bombing raids, extensive barracks and training facilities for U-boat crews, and similar facilities for other classes of raiding warship.][[0.0]]
[Bruges was therefore a vital asset in the German Navy's increasingly desperate struggle to prevent Britain from receiving food and matériel from the rest of the world.][[0.0]]
[The significance of Bruges was not lost on British naval planners and two previous attempts to close the exit at Ostend, the smaller and narrower of the Bruges canals, had ended in failure.][[0.0]]
[On 7 September 1915, four monitors of the Lord Clive class of the Dover Patrol had bombarded the dockyard, while German coastal artillery returned fire.][[0.0]]
[Only 14 rounds were fired by the British with the result that only part of the dockyard was set on fire.][[0.0]]
[In a bombardment on 22 September 1917 the lock gates were hit causing the basin to drain at low water.][[0.0]]
[Two years passed before the next attempt on the Ostend locks.][[0.0]]
[The First Ostend Raid was conducted in tandem with the similar Zeebrugge Raid led by Admiral Roger Keyes on 23 April 1918; a large scale operation to block the wider canal at Zeebrugge.][[1.0]]
[Both attacks largely failed, but whilst at Zeebrugge the operation came so close to success that it took several months for the British authorities to realise that it had been unsuccessful, at Ostend the attack had ended catastrophically.][[1.0]]
[Both blockships intended to close off the canal had grounded over half a mile from their intended location and been scuttled by their crews under heavy artillery and long-range small arms fire, which caused severe casualties.][[0.0]]
[Thus whilst Zeebrugge seemed to be blocked entirely, Ostend was open wide, nullifying any success which might have been achieved at the other port.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Planning As British forces on the South-East Coast regrouped, remanned and repaired following heavy losses at Zeebrugge, Keyes planned a return to Ostend with the intention of closing the canal and consequently severing Bruges from the sea, closing the harbour and trapping the 18 U-boats and 25 destroyers present for months to come.][[0.0]]
[Volunteers from amongst the force which had failed in April aided the planning with advice based on bitter experience.][[0.0]]
[Amongst these volunteers were Lieutenant-Commander Henry Hardy of HMS Sirius, Commander Alfred Godsal, former captain of HMS Brilliant, and Brilliant's first lieutenant Victor Crutchley.][[0.0]]
[These officers approached Commodore Hubert Lynes and Admiral Roger Keyes with a refined plan for a second attempt to block the port.][[0.0]]
[Other officers came forward to participate as well and Keyes and Lynes devised an operational plan to attack the canal mouth at Ostend once more.][[0.0]]
[Two obsolete cruisers, the aged HMS Sappho and the battered veteran of Zeebrugge HMS Vindictive were fitted out for the operation by having their non-essential equipment stripped out, their essential equipment reinforced and picked crews selected from volunteers.][[0.0]]
[The ships' forward ballast tanks were filled with concrete to both protect their bows during the attack, and act as a greater and more lasting obstacle once sunk.][[0.0]]
[Vindictive was commanded by Godsal; her six officers and 48 crew were all volunteer veterans of the previous failed attempt by HMS Brilliant.][[0.0]]
[The two sacrificial cruisers were, as with the previous attack, accompanied by four heavy monitors under Keyes' command, eight destroyers under Lynes in HMS Faulknor and five motor launches.][[0.0]]
[The launches, like the blockships, were all crewed by volunteers; mostly veterans of previous operations against the Belgian ports.][[0.0]]
[The plan was similar to the failed operation of three weeks previously.][[1.0]]
[Weather dependent, under cover of a smoke screen, aerial bombardment and offshore artillery, the blockships would steam directly into the channel, turn sideways and scuttle themselves.][[0.0]]
[Their advance would be covered by artillery fire against German shore positions from the heavy monitors at distance and at closer range by gunfire from the destroyers.][[1.0]]
[This cover was vital because Ostend was protected by a very strong 11'' gun position known as the Tirpitz battery.][[0.0]]
[Once the operation had been concluded, the motor launches would draw along the seaward side of the blockships, remove the surviving crews and take them to the monitors for passage back to Britain.][[0.0]]
[This operation should thoroughly block the channel and coupled with the blockage at Zeebrugge -LRB-which the British authorities believed to be fully closed-RRB-, should prevent use of Bruges by German raiding craft for months to come.][[1.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Attack on Ostend All preparations for the operation were completed by the first week of May and on the 9 May the weather was near-perfect for the attack.][[0.0]]
[The British armada had collected at Dunkirk in Allied-held France and departed port shortly after dark.][[0.0]]
[Two minutes after midnight, the force suffered a setback when Sappho suffered a minor boiler explosion and had to return to Dunkirk, unable to complete the journey.][[0.0]]
[Although this accident halved the ability of the force to block Ostend, Lynes decided to continue the operation, and at 01.30, the force closed on the port, making the final preparations for the assault.][[0.0]]
[Torpedoes fired from motor launches demolished machine gun posts on the ends of the piers marking the canal, beginning the attack.][[0.0]]
[Ten heavy bombers of the newly-formed Royal Air Force then flew over, dropping incendiary bombs on German positions but not causing significant damage.][[0.0]]
[At the same time, long range artillery of the Royal Marine Artillery opened fire on Ostend from Allied positions around the Belgian town of Ypres.][[0.0]]
[In preparation for the attack, Godsal and Lynes had carefully consulted available charts of Ostend following the previous operation's failure caused by German repositioning of navigation buoys.][[0.0]]
[This careful study was however rendered worthless by a sudden fog which obliterated all sight of the shore.][[0.0]]
[Steaming back and forth across the harbour entrance in the fog as the monitors and German shore batteries engaged in a long range artillery duel over the lost cruiser, Godsal looked for the piers marking the entrance to the canal.][[0.0]]
[As he searched, two German torpedo boats sailed from Ostend to intercept the cruiser, but in the heavy fog they collided and, disabled, limped back to shore.][[0.0]]
[During this period, Godsal's motor launches lost track of the cruiser in the murk, and it was not until the third pass that Vindictive found the entrance, accompanied by only one of the launches.][[0.0]]
[Heading straight into the mouth of the canal, guided by a flare dropped by the launch, Vindictive became an instant target of the German batteries and was badly damaged, the shellfire exacerbating the damage suffered in the earlier Zeebrugge Raid and seriously damaging Vindictive's port propeller.][[1.0]]
[Alfred Godsal intended to swing Vindictive broadside on into the channel mouth but as he ordered the turn, the right screw broke down completely, preventing the cruiser from fully turning.][[0.0]]
[Before this was realised on the cruiser's bridge, a shell fired from a gun battery on shore struck Commander Godsal directly, killing him instantly and shattering the bridge structure.][[0.0]]
[Most of the bridge crew were killed or wounded by the blast, including First Lieutenant Victor Crutchley, who staggered to the wheel and attempted to force the ship to make the full turn into the channel.][[0.0]]
[The damaged propeller made this move impossible and the drifting cruiser floated out of the channel and became stuck on a sandbank outside, only partially obscuring the entrance way.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Evacuation of HMS Vindictive Realising that further manoeuvring would be pointless, Crutchley ordered the charges to be blown and the ship evacuated.][[0.0]]
[As Engineer-Lieutenant William Bury prepared to detonate the scuttling charges, Crutchley took a survey of the ship and ordered all survivors to take to the boats on the seaward side of the wreck.][[0.0]]
[As men scrambled down the ship's flank away from the shells and machine-gun bullets spitting from the harbour entrance, Crutchley made a final survey with an electric torch looking for wounded men amongst the dead on the decks.][[0.0]]
[Satisfied that none alive remained aboard, he too leapt onto the deck of a motor launch bobbing below.][[0.0]]
[The rescue mission itself however was not going as planned.][[0.0]]
[Of the five motor launches attached to the expedition, only one had remained with cruiser in the fog; ML254 commanded by Lieutenant Geoffrey Drummond.][[0.0]]
[The launch, like the cruiser, was riddled with bullets; her commander was wounded and her executive officer dead.][[0.0]]
[Despite her sheltered position behind the cruiser, fire from shore continued to enfilade the launch and a number of those aboard, including Lieutenant Bury, suffered broken ankles as they jumped onto the heaving deck.][[0.0]]
[ML254 then began slowly to leave the harbour mouth, carrying 38 survivors of Vindictive's 55 crew huddled on deck, where they remained exposed to machine gun fire from the shore.][[0.0]]
[As Drummond turned his boat seawards and proceeded back to the offshore squadron which was still engaged in an artillery duel with the German defenders, one of the missing launches, ML276 passed her, having caught up with the lost cruiser at this late stage.][[0.0]]
[Drummond called to ML276's commander, Lieutenant Rowley Bourke, that he believed there were still men in the water and Bourke immediately entered the harbour to search for them.][[0.0]]
[Drummond's launch proceeded to the rendezvous with the destroyer HMS Warwick, overweighted and sinking, so severe was the damage she had suffered.][[0.0]]
[Hearing cries, Bourke entered the harbour but could not identify the lost men.][[0.0]]
[Despite heavy machine gun and artillery fire, Bourke returned to the scene of the wreck four times before they discovered two sailors and the Vindictive's badly wounded navigation officer Sir John Alleyne clinging to an upturned boat.][[0.0]]
[Hauling the men aboard, Bourke turned for the safety of the open sea but as he did two 6'' shells struck the launch, smashing the lifeboat and destroying the compressed air tanks, which stalled the engines and caused a wave of highly corrosive acid to wash over the deck, causing severe damage to the launch's hull and almost suffocating the unconscious Alleyne.][[0.0]]
[Under heavy fire, the boat staggered out of the harbour and was taken under tow by another late-arriving motor launch.][[0.0]]
[After the operation, Bourke's launch was discovered to have 55 separate bullet and shrapnel holes.][[0.0]]
[Offshore, as the Warwick's officers, Keyes' staff and the survivors of the Vindictive gathered on the destroyer's deck to discuss the operation, an enormous explosion rocked the ship causing her to list severely.][[0.0]]
[The Warwick had struck one of the defensive mines off Ostend and was now in danger of sinking herself.][[0.0]]
[The destroyer HMS Velox was lashed alongside and survivors from Warwick, Vindictive and ML254 transferred across to the sound ship.][[0.0]]
[This ragged ensemble did not reach Dover until early the following morning, the Warwick still afloat.][[0.0]]
[British casualties were reported in the immediate aftermath as being eight dead, ten missing and 29 wounded.][[0.0]]
[German losses were three killed and eight wounded.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Aftermath Despite German claims that the blockage did not impede their operations, the operation to close the Ostend canal seemed to have been at least partially successful.][[1.0]]
[The channel was largely blocked and so Bruges was ostensibly closed off from the open sea, even if the position of the blockship meant that smaller ships could get through.][[0.0]]
[In fact, however, the entire operation had been rendered moot before it even began, due to events at the wider canal in Zeebrugge.][[0.0]]
[British assessments of that operation had ultimately proven optimistic and the channel there had not been properly closed.][[0.0]]
[Small coastal submarines of the UC Class had been able to pass through the channel as early as the morning after the Zeebrugge Raid and German naval engineers were able to dredge channels around the blockages at both ports over the coming weeks.][[0.0]]
[At Ostend, the Vindictive did prevent larger warships passing through the channel, although smaller craft could still come and go at will.][[0.0]]
[Ultimately, the larger warships in Bruges were trapped there for the remaining months of the war; the town was captured by the Allies in October 1918.][[0.0]]
[Ultimately the blockages at Ostend and Zeebrugge took several years to clear completely, not being totally removed until 1921.][[0.0]]
[On a strategic scale however, the effects of the raids at Ostend and Zeebrugge on the battle of the Atlantic were negligible.][[0.0]]
[Despite this ultimate failure, in Britain the Ostend Raid was feted as a success.][[1.0]]
[Three Victoria Crosses and a host of lesser awards were given to the men involved.][[1.0]]

[-LSB-edit-RSB- Gameplay In Giants: Citizen Kabuto, players take on the roles of three humanoid races: gun-toting Meccaryns, magic-wielding Sea Reapers, and the gigantic Kabuto.][[1.0]]
[Each player is assigned direct control of a single character.][[0.0]]
[The game's developers, Planet Moon Studios, created this design to encourage players to focus on the action and not to be burdened with micromanagement.][[1.0]]
[Players can customize the controls, which are largely the same for each race, with slight differences for abilities.][[0.0]]
[The single-player mode consists of a sequence of missions set as an overarching story.][[0.0]]
[Each mission requires the completion of certain objectives to progress to the next mission.][[0.0]]
[The objectives are usually the elimination of enemies or a certain structure, but several of them test the player's eye--hand coordination or require the player to rescue and protect certain units.][[1.0]]
[Players control their characters from a default third person perspective; a first person view is optional.][[0.0]]
[Each race has its own offensive style, and a special mode of fast movement.][[0.0]]
[Killing a creature releases a power-up, which heals or awards weapons to its collector.][[0.0]]
[The real-time strategy elements of Giants consist of base building and resource gathering.][[0.0]]
[Players have to gather little humanoids called Smarties to build bases, and produce weapons or spells.][[0.0]]
[There are a limited number of Smarties in a mission, and players have to rush to gather them, or kidnap them from each other to gain an advantage.][[0.0]]
[Players also have to gather sustenance for the Smarties to make them work; Meccaryn and Reaper players hunt the cattle-like Vimps for meat and souls respectively.][[0.0]]
[The options in building a base are limited; players can neither choose the locations for the structures nor manage their workforce in detail.][[0.0]]
[In contrast, players in control of Kabuto need not build a base; the gigantic creature gains strength and produces troops through hunting for food.][[0.0]]
[Kabuto consumes Smarties to grow in size and power; at maximum size, he can produce smaller Tyrannosaurus rex-like units to function as troops.][[0.0]]
[To restore his health, Kabuto eats Vimps and other units -LRB-player- and computer-controlled-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Multiplayer mode allows a maximum of five Meccaryn, three Sea Reaper, and one Kabuto player-LRB-s-RRB- to play in each session.][[0.0]]
[Due to the lack of a game server browser, players connect through online services MPlayer or GameSpy Arcade for the Windows version, and GameRanger for the Mac OS�X version.][[0.0]]

[The surface of the rock comprises islands of varying environments, such as grasslands, deserts, and forests, surrounded by azure seas.][[0.0]]
[Players have an unobstructed view of the game world up to its horizon; distant objects are slightly blurred to convey a sense of realism.][[0.0]]
[Planet Moon Studios tailored each single-player mission's terrain to the character played in it.][[0.0]]
[As such, missions for Meccaryns provide a lot of cover to hide behind and shoot from, large spaces of water for Reapers to swim in, and plenty of creatures for Kabuto to eat.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Characters Planet Moon intended for the player characters to provide a diverse gameplay experience, laying down requirements to make the characters distinct with unique advantages and disadvantages instead of cosmetic differences.][[0.0]]
[For non-playable races, the team designed Smarties to have oversized heads, bulging eyes, and idiotic personalities for comedic effects.][[0.0]]
[They set up the Smarties' work ethics as part of a visual reward system; players labor for the Smarties while witnessing their hedonistic indulgences.][[0.0]]
[The payoff, however, is a ``giant gun''.][[0.0]]

[Nicky Bruty, Bob Stevenson, and Tim Williams initially conceived the idea of pitting players as spacemen, pirates, and giants against each other and having fun.][[0.0]]
[Initially projected for release in late 1999, the game suffered delays to its development largely due to the illness of their chief programmer, Andy Astor; he was suffering from stage IV mantle cell lymphoma in late 1999.][[0.0]]
[The team realized they needed more resources and by 2000, they had hired two more programmers and an artist.][[0.0]]
[Producing a next-generation game required them to keep up with 1998--2000's rapid advancement of technology, which resulted in further delays.][[0.0]]
[The team upsized the graphic textures as they changed the graphical software to support NVIDIA graphics cards.][[0.0]]
[Within a year after development started in 1999, the initial minimum graphics specification climbed from requiring Voodoo 1 graphics cards to those of the GeForce-series.][[0.0]]
[Planet Moon deemed game engines available during development too restrictive and inappropriate for their requirements, and built their own.][[0.0]]
[Called Amityville, it could support Glide, OpenGL, and Direct3D.][[0.0]]

[-LSB-edit-RSB- Reception Planet Moon Studios' blending of two genres in Giants has earned the acclaim of reviewers.][[0.0]]
[Game Revolution and GameSpot found the simplified real-time strategy task of resource gathering in Giants more interesting than tedious, and Troy Dunniway, Microsoft's Head of Game Design in 2002, commented that the real-time strategy elements enhanced the game's shooter aspect rather than making it a hybrid of two genres.][[1.0]]
[Sci Fi Weekly was impressed that both styles of play never interfered with each other, which was complemented by the unique gameplay of each race.][[0.0]]
[The Entertainment Depot, however, found the base building in several missions tedious; they said the player had to rebuild the base several times due to being forced to leave the base defenseless, which allowed the enemy destroy the structures.][[1.0]]
[Reviewers commented that the imaginative character designs and use of advanced graphics technology, such as hardware transform and lighting, and bump mapping, made the graphics of the game unrivaled in its time; ActionTrip was so impressed by the game's visuals that they thought their graphics card was supporting the complex hardware environmental bump mapping it was incapable of.][[0.0]]
[The animation of Kabuto's antics such as elbow dropping onto tiny enemies, and tossing up and catching food with his mouth, in particular, won the praises of reviewers.][[0.0]]
[Many critics, however, were disappointed that the computer versions of the game could not run smoothly at full details on the recommended system specifications.][[0.0]]
[The AI in the game was also the subject of much commentary.][[0.0]]
[Reviewers said they needed to prompt the allied non-player characters to perform actions on several occasions, although the allied AI performed pretty well most of the time.][[0.0]]
[FiringSquad disagreed, calling their computer controlled teammates worthless and finding joy in leaving them to their deaths.][[0.0]]
[The game review site thought the same of the enemy AI, a view echoed by IGN; enemies were unaware of the deaths of nearby teammates, and kept running into obstacles.][[0.0]]
[ActionTrip, however, stated the enemy AI did well enough to take cover or flee when hurt, and constantly attack the player's base.][[0.0]]
[Many reviewers found the best part of Giants to be its bawdy humor; the scenes were ``bizarre and funny without ever letting the silliness distract or annoy the player''.][[0.0]]
[FiringSquad claimed the humor kept them plowing through the game regardless of the issues they encountered, and were disappointed when the game steadily lost this approach in the later stages.][[0.0]]
[Mac Guild and Macworld UK, however, considered the humor crude on a child-like level and its delivery forced.][[0.0]]
[In spite of the humor, many reviewers found themselves bored by the monotony and slow pace of certain segments, According to ActionTrip, Giants lacked a unique quality to capture attention, compared to its contemporaries such as American McGee's Alice, MechWarrior 4: Vengeance, and Sea Dogs.][[0.0]]

[They called themselves the Ah-wah-ne-chee -LRB-meaning dwellers in Ahwahnee-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Like humans before and since, the Ahwahnechee changed the Valley to suit their needs.][[0.0]]
[Since the band depended upon acorns for 60% of their diet, they burned vegetation on the Valley floor, which favored California Black Oak - an acorn-producing tree.][[0.0]]
[Fire management also expanded meadows and reduced brush within woodlands, thus making ambush by invading tribes difficult.][[0.0]]
[Displaced Native Americans from the coast of California moved to the Sierra Nevada in the early to mid-19th century.][[1.0]]
[They brought their experiences with Spanish food, technology, and clothing as they joined tribes in the mountains.][[0.0]]
[Together they raided ranchos on the coast and drove herds of horses to the Sierra, where horse meat became a major new food source.][[0.0]]

[He and his party also likely happened upon either the Tuolumne or Merced Groves of Giant Sequoia, becoming the first known non-indigenous people to see the giant trees.][[0.0]]
[The part of the Sierra Nevada where the park is located was long considered to be a physical barrier to non-indigenous settlers, traders, trappers, and travelers.][[0.0]]
[That status changed, in 1848, due to the discovery of gold in the foothills west of the range in the California Gold Rush.][[0.0]]

[On Thursday March 27 of that year the company of 50 to 60 men reached what is now called Old Inspiration Point and saw the major features of the Valley laid out before them -LRB-they named the overlook Mt. Beatitude-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Attached to Savage's unit was Dr. Lafayette Bunnell, the company physician who later wrote about his awestruck impressions of the valley in The Discovery of the Yosemite.][[0.0]]
[While camped at Bridalveil Meadow Bunnell suggested that the Valley be named '``Yo-sem-ity'', after what the surrounding Sierra Miwok tribes, who feared the Yosemite Valley tribe, called them.][[0.0]]
[At the time, Savage, who spoke some native dialects, translated this as ``full-grown grizzly bear''.][[0.0]]
[Later translations found that the actual term, while possibly derived or at least confused with the similar uzumati or uhumati -LRB-meaning `grizzly bear'-RRB-, was in fact a Southern Sierra Miwok word Yohhe`meti meaning ``they are killers''.][[0.0]]
[The name stuck even though the tribe they named the valley after called themselves Ahwahnechee.][[0.0]]
[Bunnell went on to name many other local topographic features on the same trip.][[0.0]]
[Others in the company were also moved by what they saw and recounted their journey to friends and family after they returned, increasing interest in the Valley and surrounding area.][[0.0]]

[-LSB-edit-RSB- John Muir's influence and the national park Scotland-born naturalist John Muir first came to California in March 1868 and immediately set out for the Yosemite area.][[1.0]]
[Muir studied the area's plants, rocks and animals in the summer of 1869 while employed by rancher Pat Delaney to accompany his sheep and sheepherder.][[0.0]]
[Soon after, Hutchings hired Muir to operate a sawmill.][[0.0]]
[Articles written by Muir helped to both popularize the area and increase scientific interest in it.][[0.0]]
[Muir was one of the first to theorize that the major landforms in Yosemite were created by large alpine glaciers, bucking established scientists such as Josiah Whitney who regarded Muir as an amateur -LRB-see geology of the Yosemite area-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Muir also wrote scientific papers on the area's biology.][[0.0]]
[Alarmed by over-grazing of meadows -LRB-especially by sheep who Muir called ``hooved locusts''-RRB-, logging of Giant Sequoia, and other damage, Muir changed from being a promoter and scientist to an advocate for further protection.][[0.0]]
[As part of this new role he persuaded many influential people to accompany him to camp in the park, such as Ralph Waldo Emerson in 1871.][[0.0]]
[On these trips Muir would try to convince his guests of the importance of putting the area under federal protection.][[0.0]]
[None of his guests through the 1880s could do much for Muir's cause except for Robert Underwood Johnson, who was editor of Century Magazine.][[0.0]]
[Through Johnson, Muir had a national audience for his writing and a highly motivated and crafty Congressional lobbyist.][[0.0]]

[The Act withdrew these lands from ``settlement, occupancy, or sale'' and protected ``all timber, mineral deposits, natural curiosities or wonders'' along with prohibiting ``wanton destruction of the fish and game and their capture or destruction for the purposes of merchandise or profit''.][[0.0]]
[This was the first time the federal government set aside land for such a purpose.][[0.0]]
[It is important to note, that Yosemite National Park does include the entire upper drainages of two separate river watersheds -LRB-which was very important to Muir who said ``you cannot save Yosemite Valley without saving its Sierran fountains.''-RRB-][[0.0]]

[Emperor Xian had been a political figurehead since 189, with no control over the actions of the various warlords controlling their respective territories.][[0.0]]
[One of the most powerful rulers in northern China was the warlord Cao Cao, who, by the year 207, had unified northern China and retained total control of the North China Plain.][[0.0]]
[He then completed a successful campaign against the Wuhuan in the winter of the same year, thus securing his northern frontier.][[0.0]]
[Upon his return in 208, he was proclaimed to be the Imperial Chancellor of Han, a position that granted him absolute authority over the entire imperial government -LRB-de Crespigny 1969:253, 465 6n-RRB-.][[0.0]]

[As Huang Gai's ``defecting'' squadron approached the midpoint of the river, the sailors applied fire to the ships before taking to small boats.][[0.0]]
[The unmanned fire ships, carried by the southeastern wind, sped towards Cao Cao's fleet and set it ablaze.][[0.0]]
[Within a short time smoke and flames stretched across the sky, and a large number of men and horses either burned to death or drowned -LRB-Chen c. 280:54.1262-63-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Following the initial shock, Zhou Yu and the allies led a lightly armed force to capitalise on the assault.][[0.0]]
[The northern army was thrown into confusion and was utterly smashed.][[0.0]]
[Seeing the situation was hopeless, Cao Cao then issued a general order of retreat and destroyed a number of his remaining ships before withdrawing -LRB-Chen c. 280-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Cao Cao's army attempted a retreat along Huarong Road, including a long stretch passing through marshlands north of Dongting Lake.][[0.0]]
[Heavy rains had reduced the track to a thick mire, making the road so treacherous that many of the sick soldiers had to carry bundles of grass on their backs and use them to fill the road, to allow the horsemen to cross.][[0.0]]
[Many of these soldiers drowned in the mud or were trampled to death in the effort.][[0.0]]
[To the misery of Cao Cao's army, the allies, led by Zhou Yu and Liu Bei, gave chase over land and water until they reached Nan Commandery -LRB-南郡-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Combined with famine and disease, this decimated Cao Cao's remaining forces.][[0.0]]
[Cao Cao then retreated north to his home base of Ye, leaving Cao Ren and Xu Huang to guard Jiangling, Yue Jin stationed in Xiangyang, and Man Chong in Dangyang -LRB-Chen c. 280-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[The allied counterattack might have vanquished Cao Cao and his forces entirely.][[0.0]]
[However, the crossing of the Yangtze River dissolved into chaos as the allied armies converged on the riverbank and fought over the limited number of ferries.][[0.0]]
[To restore order, a detachment led by the allied general Gan Ning established a bridgehead in Yiling to the north, and only a staunch rearguard action by Cao Ren prevented further catastrophe -LRB-Eikenberry 1994:60; de Crespigny 2007:239-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Analysis A combination of Cao Cao's strategic errors and the effectiveness of Huang Gai's ruse had resulted in the allied victory at the Battle of Red Cliffs.][[0.0]]
[Zhou Yu had previously observed that Cao Cao's generals and soldiers comprised mostly cavalry and infantry, and few had any experience in naval warfare.][[0.0]]
[Cao Cao also had little support among the people of Jing province, and thus lacked a secure forward base of operations -LRB-Eikenberry 1994:60-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Despite the strategic acumen Cao Cao had displayed in earlier campaigns and battles, in this case he had simply assumed that numerical superiority would eventually defeat the Sun and Liu navy.][[0.0]]
[Cao's first tactical mistake was converting his massive army of infantry and cavalry into a marine corps and navy: with only a few days of drills before the battle, Cao Cao's troops were ravaged by sea-sickness and lack of experience on water.][[0.0]]
[Tropical diseases, to which the southerners had long been immune, also plagued the soldiers of the north with the debilitating effects of sickness rampant in Cao Cao's camps.][[0.0]]
[Although numerous, Cao Cao's men were already exhausted by the unfamiliar environment and the extended southern campaign, as Zhuge Liang observed: ``Even a powerful arrow at the end of its flight cannot penetrate a silk cloth'' -LRB-Military Documents 1979:193-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[The uncharacteristically poor preparation and miscalculations displayed by Cao Cao during this campaign may have been partly due to the recent death of his strategist and advisor Guo Jia.][[0.0]]
[Cao Cao himself had commented: ``Had Guo Jia been with us, I would never have got into such trouble'' -LRB-Chen c. 280:14:433-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Another key advisor, Jia Xu, had recommended after the surrender of Liu Cong that the overtaxed armies be given time to rest and replenish before engaging the armies of Sun Quan and Liu Bei, but Cao Cao disregarded the advice -LRB-Eikenberry 1994:60-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Cao Cao's own thoughts regarding his failure at Red Cliffs suggest that he held his own actions and misfortunes responsible for the defeat, rather than the strategies utilised by his enemy during the battle: ''...it was only because of the sickness that I burnt my ships and retreated.][[0.0]]
[It is out of all reason for Zhou Yu to take the credit for himself.''][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Aftermath By the end of 209, the post Cao Cao had established at Jiangling fell to Zhou Yu.][[0.0]]
[The borders of the land under Cao Cao's control contracted about 160�kilometres -LRB-100�miles-RRB-, to the area around Xiangyang -LRB-de Crespigny 2004:291-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Liu Bei, on the other hand, had gained territory by taking over the four commanderies south of the Yangtze River.][[0.0]]
[Sun Quan's troops had suffered far greater casualties than Liu Bei's in the extended conflict against Cao Ren following the Battle of Red Cliffs -LRB-de Crespigny 2004:291--292-RRB-, and the death of Zhou Yu in 210 resulted in a drastic weakening of Sun Quan's strength in the Jing province -LRB-de Crespigny 2004:297-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Liu Bei also occupied the Jing province that Cao Cao had recently lost--a strategic and naturally fortified area on the Yangtze River that Wu claimed for itself.][[0.0]]
[The control of Jing provided Liu Bei with virtually unlimited access to the passage into Shu and important waterways into Wu, as well as dominion of the southern Yangtze River.][[1.0]]
[Never again would Cao Cao command so large a fleet as he had at Jiangling, nor would a similar opportunity to destroy his southern rivals present itself again -LRB-de Crespigny 2007:37-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[The Battle of Red Cliffs and the capture of Jing province by Liu Bei confirmed the separation of Southern China from the northern heartland of the Yellow River valley, and also foreshadowed a north-south axis of hostility which would resonate for centuries -LRB-de Crespigny 2004:260-RRB-.][[1.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Location The precise location of the Red Cliffs battlefield has long been the subject of both popular and academic debates, but has never been conclusively established.][[0.0]]
[Scholarly debates have continued for at least 1,350 years -LRB-Zhang 2006:215-RRB-, and a number of arguments in favour of alternative sites have been put forward.][[0.0]]
[There are clear grounds for rejecting at least some of these proposals, but four alternative locations are still advocated.][[0.0]]
[According to Zhang -LRB-2006-RRB-, many of the current debates stem from the fact that the course and length of the Yangtze River between Wuli and Wuhan has changed since the Sui and Tang dynasties -LRB-Zhang 2006:225-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[The modern-day debate is also complicated by the fact that the names of some of the key locations have changed over the following centuries.][[0.0]]
[For example, although modern Huarong city is located in Hunan, south of the Yangtze, in the 3rd century the city of that name was due east of Jiangling, considerably north of the Yangtze -LRB-Zhang 2006:229; de Crespigny 2004:256 78n-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Moreover, one candidate site, Puqi -LRB-蒲圻-RRB-, was renamed ``Chibi City'' -LRB-赤壁市-RRB- in 1998 in a direct attempt to tie this location to the historical battlefield.][[0.0]]
[Historical records state that Cao Cao's forces retreated north across the Yangtze after the initial engagement at Red Cliffs, unequivocally placing the battle site on the south bank of the Yangtze.][[0.0]]
[For this reason, a number of sites on the north bank have been discounted by historians and geographers.][[0.0]]
[Historical accounts also establish east and west boundaries for a stretch of the Yangtze which encompasses all possible sites for the battlefield.][[0.0]]
[The allied forces travelled upstream from either Fankou or Xiakou.][[0.0]]
[Since the Yangtze flows roughly eastward towards the ocean -LRB-with northeast and southeast meanders-RRB-, Red Cliffs must at least be west of Fankou, which is farther downstream.][[0.0]]
[The westernmost boundary is also clear, since Cao Cao's eastern advance from Jiangling included passing Baqiu -LRB-modern Yueyang city in Hunan province-RRB- on the shore of Dongting Lake.][[1.0]]
[The battle must also have been downstream -LRB-northeast-RRB- of that location -LRB-de Crespigny 2004:256--257; Zhang 2006:217-RRB-.][[1.0]]
[One popular candidate for the battle site is Chibi Hill in Huangzhou, sometimes referred to as ``Su Dongpo's Red Cliffs'' or the ``Literary Red Cliffs'' -LRB-文赤壁-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Support for this conjecture arises largely due to the famous 11th-century poem ``First Rhapsody on the Red Cliffs,'' which equates the Huangzhou Hill with the battlefield location.][[0.0]]
[The pinyin Romanization of this cliff's name is ``Chibi'', the same as the pinyin for Red Cliffs.][[0.0]]
[However, the Chinese characters are completely different -LRB-赤鼻-RRB- as is their meaning -LRB-``Red Nose Hill''-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[This site is also on the north bank of the Yangtze, and is directly across from Fankou rather than upstream from it -LRB-Zhang 2006:215-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Moreover, if the allied Sun/Liu forces left from Xiakou rather than Fankou, as the oldest historical sources suggest, then the hill in Huangzhou would have been downstream from the point of departure, a possibility which cannot be reconciled with historical sources.][[0.0]]
[Puqi, now named Chibi City, is perhaps the most widely accepted candidate.][[0.0]]
[To differentiate from Su Dongpo's Red Cliffs, the site is also referred to as the ``Military Red Cliffs'' -LRB-武赤壁-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[It is directly across the Yangtze from Wulin.][[0.0]]
[This argument was first proposed in the early Tang Dynasty -LRB-Zhang 2006:217-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[There are also characters engraved in the cliffs -LRB-see image at the top of this page-RRB- suggesting that this is the site of the battle.][[0.0]]
[The origin of the engraving can be dated to between the Tang and Song dynasties, making it at least 1,000 years old -LRB-Zhang 2006:219;228-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Some sources mention the south banks of the Yangtze in Jiayu County -LRB-嘉鱼县-RRB- in the prefecture-level city of Xianning in Hubei province as a possible location.][[0.0]]
[This would place the battlefield downstream from Puqi -LRB-Chibi City-RRB-, a view that is supported by scholars of Chinese history such as Rafe de Crespigny, Wang Li and Zhu Dongrun, following the Qing Dynasty historical document Shui Jing Zhu -LRB-de Crespigny 2004:256-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Another candidate is Wuhan, which straddles the Yangtze at the confluence of the Yangtze and Han rivers.][[0.0]]
[It is east of both Wulin -LRB-and Chibi City across the river-RRB- and Jiayu.][[0.0]]
[This metropolis was incorporated by joining three cities.][[0.0]]
[There is a local belief in Wuhan that the battle was fought at the junction of the rivers, southwest of the former Wuchang city, which is now part of Wuhan -LRB-de Crespigny 2004:256 n 78-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Zhang -LRB-2006:215;223-RRB- asserts that the Chibi battlefield was one of a set of hills in Wuchang that were levelled in the 1930s so that their stone could be used as raw material.][[0.0]]
[Citing several historical-geographical studies, Zhang -LRB-2006-RRB- shows that earlier accounts place the battlefield in Wuchang.][[0.0]]
[Sheng Honzhi's 5th-century Jingzhou ji in particular places the Chibi battlefield a distance of 160�li -LRB-approximately 80�kilometres -LRB-50�mi-RRB--RRB- downstream from Wulin, but since the Paizhou and Luxikou meanders increased the length of the Yangtze River between Wuli and Wuchang by 100�li -LRB-approximately 50�kilometres -LRB-31�mi-RRB-; see map-RRB- some time in the Sui and Tang dynasties -LRB-Zhang 2006:225-RRB-, later works do not regard Wuchang as a possible site.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Fictionalised account The romantic tradition that originated with the Romance of the Three Kingdoms differs from historical accounts in many details.][[1.0]]
[For example, Cao Cao's army strength was exaggerated to over 800,000 men.][[0.0]]
[This may be attributed to the ethos of later times, particularly of the Southern Song Dynasty -LRB-de Crespigny 2007:483-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[The Shu kingdom in particular was viewed by later literati as the ``legitimate'' successor to the Han empire, so fictionalised accounts assign greater prominence than the historical records warrant to the roles of Liu Bei, Zhuge Liang and other heroes from Shu.][[0.0]]
[This is generally accomplished by minimising the importance of Wu commanders and advisors such as Zhou Yu and Lu Su -LRB-de Crespigny 2004:xi-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[While historical accounts describe Lu Su as a sensible advisor and Zhou Yu as an eminent military leader and ``generous, sensible and courageous'' man, the Romance of the Three Kingdoms depicts Lu Su as unremarkable and Zhou Yu as cruel and cynical -LRB-de Crespigny 2004:300; 305--306 29n-RRB-.][[1.0]]
[Both are depicted as being inferior to Zhuge Liang in every respect -LRB-de Crespigny 2004:264-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[The romances added wholly fictional and fantastical elements to the historical accounts and these were repeated in popular plays and operas.][[0.0]]
[Examples from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms include Zhuge Liang using magic to call forth favourable winds for the fire ship attack, his strategy of ``using straw boats to borrow arrows'', and Guan Yu capturing and releasing Cao Cao at Huarong Trail.][[0.0]]
[The fictionalised accounts also name Zhuge Liang as a military commander in the combined forces, which is not historically accurate -LRB-de Crespigny 2004:260-264-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Modern and cultural impact Modern day Chibi City in Hubei province was formerly named Puqi.][[0.0]]

[-LSB-edit-RSB- Gameplay Ōkami has the player controlling the main character, Amaterasu, in a woodcut, watercolor style, cel-shaded environment, which looks like an animated Japanese ink-illustration -LRB-known as sumi-e-RRB- with other styles of art.][[0.0]]
[The gameplay style is a mix of action, platform, and puzzle gaming genres, and has been noted by many reviewers to have numerous similarities in overall gameplay style to The Legend of Zelda series, an inspiration that director Hideki Kamiya, a self-proclaimed Zelda-fan, has admitted has influenced his general game design.][[0.0]]
[The main story is primarily linear, directed through by Amaterasu's guide Issun, though numerous side quests and optional activities allow for players to explore the game world and take the story at their own pace.][[0.0]]
[By completing quests, side quests and small additional activities -LRB-such as making trees bloom into life or feeding wild animals-RRB-, Amaterasu earns Praise, which can then be spent to increase various statistics of the character, such as the amount of health and number of ink wells for Celestial Brush techniques.][[0.0]]
[Combat is staged in a ghostly virtual arena, and Amaterasu can fight enemies using a combination of weapons, fighting techniques and Brush methods to dispatch the foes.][[0.0]]
[At the end of combat, money -LRB-as yen-RRB- is rewarded to Amaterasu, with bonuses for completing a battle quickly and without taking damage.][[0.0]]
[The money can be spent on numerous items from merchants across the land, including healing goods, better weapons, tools and key items for completing quests.][[0.0]]
[The money can also be used to buy new combat techniques at dojos throughout the land.][[0.0]]
[Additionally, rare Demon Fangs can be earned through combat which can be traded for additional, unique items that are beneficial in gameplay but not required to complete the game.][[0.0]]
[Weapons inspired by the Imperial Regalia of Japan, the Reflector, the Rosaries and the Glaive can be equipped on Amaterasu as either a main or sub-weapon, and used in addition to other melee attacks that the player can have Amaterasu learn through the course of the game.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Celestial Brush Unique to Ōkami is the Celestial Brush.][[0.0]]
[Players can bring the game to a pause and call up a canvas, where the player can draw onto the screen, either using the left analog stick on the PlayStation 2's DualShock controller or pointing with the Wii Remote.][[0.0]]
[This feature is used in combat, puzzles and as general gameplay.][[0.0]]
[For example, the player can create strong wind by drawing a loop, cut enemies by drawing a line through them or create bridges by painting one, amongst many other abilities.][[0.0]]
[These techniques are learned through the course of the game by completing constellations to release the Celestial Brush gods -LRB-inspired by the Chinese zodiac-RRB- from their hiding spots.][[0.0]]
[It is also possible to upgrade or modify certain Brush powers later in the game.][[0.0]]
[For example, the Celestial Brush power Inferno can gain a new power called Fireburst, which has a different drawing pattern, and allows players to create flames without relying on torches or other related items.][[0.0]]
[The player's ink for drawing is limited by the amount available in special ink wells, preventing the player from solely using Brush techniques to defeat enemies; ink is restored in the wells over time when the Brush is not used.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Plot -LRB-Note: Most character names below are the shortened names of the U.S. version.-RRB-][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Story The game is set in Nippon based on Japanese classic history, and begins with a flashback to events 100 years prior to the game's present, and describes how Shiranui, a pure white wolf, and Nagi, a swordsman, together fought the eight-headed demon Orochi to save Kamiki Village and the maiden Nami, Nagi's beloved.][[0.0]]
[Shiranui and Nagi are unable to defeat Orochi but manage to seal the demon away.][[0.0]]
[In the game's present, Susano, a descendant of Nagi and self-proclaimed greatest warrior, breaks Orochi's seal due to the fact that he does not believe in the legend, and Orochi escapes and curses the lands, sapping the life from every living being.][[0.0]]
[Sakuya, the wood sprite and guardian of Kamiki Village, calls forth Amaterasu, the sun goddess, known to the villagers as the reincarnation of the white wolf Shiranui, and pleads her to remove the curse that covers the land.][[0.0]]
[Accompanied by the artist Issun -LRB-an inch-high Poncle-RRB-, Amaterasu is able to restore the land to its former beauty.][[0.0]]
[Throughout the journey, Amaterasu is hounded by Waka, a strange but powerful individual that seems to have the gift of foresight, and further teases Amaterasu and Issun to his own mysterious ends.][[0.0]]
[Additionally, Amaterasu locates several Celestial Gods who have hidden in the constellations that bestow upon the goddess powers of the Celestial Brush to aid in her quest.][[0.0]]
[Soon, Amaterasu, along with Susano, must battle Orochi to protect Kamiki Village and rescue Susano's beloved, Kushi, recreating events from 100 years prior.][[0.0]]
[This time, the duo are able to fully conquer the demon, causing a black, evil spirit to float northward.][[0.0]]
[Amaterasu and Issun then embark on a journey across Nippon and continue to remove Orochi's curse on the land through defeating other demons that release similar dark presences floating northward.][[0.0]]
[As Amaterasu travels to find the source of these evil spirits, she is brought to the wreckage of a ship able to travel through the stars: the ``Ark of Yamato''.][[0.0]]
[Waka appears and reveals himself as a member of the Moon Tribe, a race that had supplied the Ark of Yamato to the Celestial Beings, who used it to escape from Orochi's assault on the Celestial Plain and sail the heavens, unaware of the evil spirits imprisoned on the Ark which attacked and killed all but himself, resulting in the Ark crashing to earth.][[0.0]]
[Amaterasu defeats Yami, the demon controlling all the evil spirits, and rids both the Ark and Nippon of these evil beings forever.][[0.0]]
[With her mission done, Amaterasu departs with Waka on the Ark to sail back to the Celestial Plain together.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Characters The player controls Ōkami Amaterasu, the goddess of the sun, in the form of a white wolf.][[1.0]]
[While Amaterasu is referred to in the Japanese and European version of the game as a female, the North American version never states Amaterasu as a specific sex.][[0.0]]
[Some characters, however, will refer to Amaterasu in either a feminine or masculine method, but neither are shown to be correct nor incorrect.][[0.0]]
[While Amaterasu, when endowed with ink power, is seen by the player with red markings, cloud-like fur on her shoulders, and weapons on her back, most of the human characters in the game only see her as a plain white wolf; some believe Amaterasu to be the reincarnation of Shiranui -LRB-the white wolf that fought Orochi 100 years prior to the game's present-RRB-, and do not recognize her spiritual nature.][[0.0]]
[If the player depletes their power by overuse of the celestial brush, Amaterasu will temporarily revert to this mundane white form.][[0.0]]
[Issun, an arrogant, inch-tall ``wandering artist'' seeking out the 13 Celestial Brush techniques for himself, accompanies Amaterasu -LRB-whom he calls ``Ammy'' or ``furball''-RRB- and serves as a guide, dialog proxy, and as comic relief He grows in character along with Ammy throughout the game, eventually becoming her true friend, inspiration, and eventually her savior.][[0.0]]
[While there is not a main singular antagonist within the game, two characters reappear several times within the quest.][[0.0]]
[Waka appears as a young flute-playing man to Amaterasu several times in the game, aware of the goddess's form of the white wolf and foretelling of her future and at times battling with her; his dialogue, dropping French affectionate terms at times, conveys a sense of familiarity with Amaterasu, as it turns out that Waka is much older than he appears and has walked with Amaterasu on the Celestial Plain hundreds of years ago.][[0.0]]
[The other is Orochi, the eight-headed demon and a major villain within the game which the player will encounter several times.][[0.0]]
[Orochi repeatedly has threatened Kamiki village, demanding a sacrifice of a young woman.][[0.0]]
[Each of its eight heads is infused with a different elemental magic power, but the entire demon is susceptible to a special brew of sake available only at Kamiki Village, allowing Amaterasu to defeat it while in its stupor.][[0.0]]
[Throughout the game, the player encounters several other characters that are inspired from Japanese folklore.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Development Ōkami resulted from the combined ideas of Clover Studio.][[0.0]]
[The game was originally built around ``depict-LSB-ing-RSB- a lot of nature'', but had no central concept or theme, according to lead designer Hideki Kamiya.][[0.0]]
[Kamiya eventually created a minute-long demonstration movie showing a wolf running about a forest, with flowers blossoming in its wake, but still lacked any gameplay.][[0.0]]
[Kamiya and other members of the team introduced ideas around the nature aspect and eventually led to the game's initial prototype, which Kamiya admitted was ``incredibly boring to play''.][[0.0]]
[Kamiya suggested that he allowed so many ideas from the team that resulted in the development moving off-target, including creating more of a simulation.][[0.0]]
[Eventually, they settled onto the gameplay found in the final product.][[0.0]]
[The art in Ōkami is highly inspired by Japanese watercolor and wood carving art of the Ukiyo-e style, such as the work of Hokusai.][[0.0]]
[Ōkami was originally planned to be rendered in a more photorealistic 3D style.][[1.0]]
[However, Clover Studio determined that the more colorful sumi-e style allowed them to better convey Amaterasu's association with nature and the task of restoring it.][[0.0]]
[The change was also influenced by limitations in the PS2 hardware to render the photorealistic 3D graphics.][[0.0]]
[As a result of the switch to the watercolor style, the idea of the Celestial Brush came about.][[0.0]]
[Atsushi Inaba, CEO of Clover, noted that ``Once we fixed ourselves on a graphical style and got down to the brushwork, we thought `Wouldn't it be great if we could somehow get the player involved and participate in this artwork instead of just watching it?'][[0.0]]
[That's how the idea of the Celestial Brush was born''.][[0.0]]
[Original concepts for enemies included the use of dinosaurs, but the designs settled onto more demon-like characters.][[0.0]]
[Amaterasu's initial designs were aimed to avoid having the character look like ``your pet wearing clothing''.][[0.0]]
[The developers had considered having Amaterasu change into a dolphin when in the water and a falcon when jumping off a cliff, but dropped these ideas.][[0.0]]
[Sakuya, designed around a peach motif, was envisioned with what were called ``level 2'' and ``level 3'' designs where the character would wear less clothing as the story progressed, but the ``level 3'' appearance, effectively naked, was vetoed by Inaba.][[0.0]]
[Waka's character was aimed to be a Tatsunoko-like character, with the hood designed to be reminiscent of those worn by the Gatchaman.][[0.0]]
[Orochi in Japanese mythology is a gigantic creature, so lead character designer Takeyasu Sawaki designed the back of the demon to include a garden and palace; this inspired the game designers to include a bell in those structures that would be Orochi's fatal weakness in the game.][[0.0]]
[The localization team had to translate 1500 pages of text to make sure it made sense in a ``native check'', due to lack of plurals in the Japanese language and the large number of characters and conditional conversations that the player could interact with.][[0.0]]
[The team recognized that certain elements of the game would not be recognized by Western audiences, but left enough text and details to allow the players to look up the information for themselves.][[0.0]]
[Only one puzzle in the game had to be changed as it required knowledge of the steps in drawing a kanji character which would be readily known for Japanese audiences; for the Western release, these steps were demonstrated in the game.][[0.0]]
[The team noted that personalities of characters could be easily conveyed in Japanese text simply by the way sentences were constructed or slurred, a feature that could not directly be applied to localization.][[0.0]]
[Instead, working with Kamiya, the team scripted the localization to either recreate the personality to match the Japanese version, or to create a whole new set of mannerisms for the characters as appropriate.][[0.0]]
[Ōkami was shown at the 2005 E3 Convention, approximately 30% complete, with a planned release in 2006.][[0.0]]
[At this point, the game had much of the core gameplay, including the Celestial Brush and the combat system in place.][[0.0]]
[The game was released a year later in 2006.][[0.0]]
[However, just a few weeks following its release in North America to strong critical reception, Capcom announced the closure of Clover Studio.][[0.0]]
[The Ōkami: Official Complete Works art book was published by Udon in May 2008.][[0.0]]
[The game was re-released under Sony's ``Greatest Hits'' in Japan in August 2008.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Naming and allusions The title of the game is a pun; the word ōkami -LRB-狼-RRB- in Japanese means ``wolf''.][[0.0]]
[However, the kanji characters used as the title of this game -LRB-大神-RRB-, pronounced identically, mean ``great deity'', so the main character is a great wolf deity.][[0.0]]
[The same characters -LRB-大神-RRB- are also used to write the full name of the sun goddess Amaterasu Ōmikami.][[0.0]]
[The localization team opted to use shorter versions of Japanese names -LRB-for example, a boy named ``Mushikai'' was localized as ``Mushi''-RRB- instead of replacing the names with Western-style ones.][[0.0]]

[-LSB-edit-RSB- Wii version The gameplay function of ``drawing'' or ``painting'' strokes on the screen led several journalists and gamers alike to believe that Ōkami would be well-suited for the Nintendo DS or Wii, both of which feature controls capable of creating drawing motions freely.][[0.0]]
[After the game's release, industry rumors of the game being ported to either console persisted, despite Atsushi Inaba of Clover Studio feeling that Ōkami's action-based gameplay would not translate well to the console and statements from Capcom that there were ``no plans for Ōkami on Wii''.][[1.0]]
[However, at the 2007 UK Gamers Day, Capcom announced that Ready at Dawn would oversee porting and development of a Wii version of Ōkami originally scheduled for release in March 2008 but subsequently pushed back to April 2008.][[0.0]]
[Christian Svensson, Capcom's Vice-President of Strategic Planning and Business Development, stated that Capcom had received numerous requests from fans for the development of the Wii version, and that the ported game ``specifically exists because of that direct communication, especially those we receive on our message boards -LRB-even if they're sometimes mean to us-RRB-.''][[0.0]]
[Ready at Dawn president Didier Malenfant has stated that, aside from the control scheme, the Wii version will be ``an exact port of the PS2 version.''][[0.0]]
[The lack of enhancements for the game caused several complaints from gamers, to which Svensson addressed, stating that Svensson reported that the original game assets given to them from Capcom Japan were incomplete, and even after requesting old hard drives and computers to recover more assets, Ready at Dawn was still required to recreate some from scratch.][[0.0]]
[Furthermore, the game had to be recoded to change optimizations that were made for the PlayStation 2 version; Svensson stated that ``part of the reason we didn't show it until we started showing it was because, if we showed it in a form that was anything less than near-perfect, people were going to freak out''.][[0.0]]
[On 15 November 2007, Svensson noted that the engine had been ported to the Wii, writing that ``There are still several systems getting set up properly but there's most definitely a Wii-driven Amaterasu running around Wii-rendered environments as we speak.''][[0.0]]
[A listing posted at Capcom's website for the game on 15 February 2008 revealed that the Wii version would support 480p and widescreen output, and IGN confirmed that the motion sensing of the Wii Remote would be used to perform the Celestial Brush features within the game.][[1.0]]
[IGN's hands-on also cited small changes to the game such as additional motion-sensing controls using both the Wii Remote and Nunchuck attachment, and the ability to skip cutscenes, but reported no other changes in content of the game.][[0.0]]
[Svennson noted that Capcom would not use television advertising for Ōkami on the Wii, but would use online marketing, including art contests and a new website with ``all sorts of things for fans to use to make stuff''.][[0.0]]
[This site was made live on 3 April 2008, featuring wallpapers, character artwork and fan-created art for the game.][[0.0]]

[-LSB-edit-RSB- Seasonal forecasts On May�22, 2006, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -LRB-NOAA-RRB- released their forecasts for the 2006 Atlantic, East Pacific, and Central Pacific hurricane seasons.][[1.0]]
[The Pacific season was expected to be hindered by the decades-long cycle that began in 1995, which generally increased wind shear across the basin.][[0.0]]
[NOAA predicted a below-normal level of activity in the Eastern Pacific, with 12--16�named storms, of which 6--8 were expected to become hurricanes, and 1--3 expected to become major hurricanes.][[1.0]]
[The Central Pacific basin was also expected to be below average, with only two to three tropical cyclones expected to form or cross into the area.][[1.0]]
[They expected that neither El Niño nor La Niña would affect conditions significantly.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Storms -LSB-edit-RSB- May and June On May�15, the hurricane season began in the Eastern Pacific basin, which is the area of the northern Pacific Ocean east of 140ºW.][[1.0]]
[Twelve days later, an area of disturbed weather developed into the first tropical depression of the season, about 190�mi -LRB-310�km-RRB- south of Acapulco, Mexico.][[0.0]]
[It quickly intensified into a tropical storm, and upon doing so was named Aletta.][[0.0]]
[The storm drifted northeastward toward the coast, bringing light rainfall before turning southward.][[0.0]]
[Wind shear weakened the storm, and on May�31 Aletta dissipated about 200�mi -LRB-320�km-RRB- west-northwest of where it formed.][[0.0]]
[On June�1, the season began in the Central Pacific basin, which is the region between 140ºW and the International Dateline; however, no storms occurred in the basin until July.][[0.0]]
[In the Eastern Pacific, Tropical Depression Two-E formed on June�3 about 145�mi -LRB-245�km-RRB- southwest of Zihuatanejo, Mexico.][[0.0]]
[It tracked eastward and brought heavy rainfall to the coastline, with a report of about 11�inches -LRB-280�mm-RRB- in Acapulco.][[0.0]]
[Land interaction weakened the depression, and it dissipated on June�5.][[0.0]]
[No tropical storms developed in June in the basin, which was unusual compared to the average of two storms forming during the month.][[0.0]]

[Its low-level circulation persisted for three days before dissipating.][[0.0]]
[As the previous two storms were dissipating, a new tropical depression formed off the southwest coast of Mexico on July�16, which would later become Hurricane Daniel.][[0.0]]
[It moved westward, gradually intensifying under favorable conditions.][[0.0]]
[On July�22, it attained peak winds of 150�mph -LRB-240�km/h-RRB-, a Category�4 on the Saffir-Simpson scale and making Daniel the strongest hurricane during the season in the NHC area of responsibility.][[0.0]]
[Maintaining Category�4 status for about three days, the hurricane subsequently weakened quickly due to cooler waters.][[0.0]]

[On August�18, it attained peak winds of 110�mph -LRB-175�km/h-RRB-, before gradually weakening due to cooler waters.][[0.0]]
[Weakening to a tropical storm on August�20, it later turned sharply to the west, degenerating into a remnant low on August�23 and dissipating the next day without affecting land.][[0.0]]
[The strongest hurricane of the season was Hurricane Ioke, which formed on August�20 far to the south of Hawaii.][[0.0]]
[It was the first central Pacific named storm since Hurricane Huko in 2002.][[0.0]]
[Encountering warm waters and little wind shear, and maintaining well-defined outflow, Ioke intensified from a tropical depression to Category�4 status on the Saffir-Simpson scale within 48�hours.][[0.0]]
[Late on August�22 it rapidly weakened to Category�2 status before crossing over Johnston Atoll, where 12�people rode out the storm in a hurricane-proof bunker.][[0.0]]
[Two days later, favorable conditions again allowed for rapid strengthening, and Ioke attained Category�5 status on August�25 before crossing the International Date Line.][[0.0]]
[As it continued westward its intensity fluctuated, and on August�31 it passed near Wake Island with winds of 155�mph -LRB-249�km/h-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Ioke gradually weakened as it turned northwestward and northward, and by September�6 transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.][[0.0]]
[The remnants of Ioke accelerated northeastward and ultimately crossed into Alaska.][[1.0]]
[On August�21 shortly after the previous storm formed, Hurricane Ileana developed off the southwest coast of Mexico.][[0.0]]

[The next tropical depression, which would eventually become Hurricane John, formed on August�28 about 250�mi -LRB-400�km-RRB- off the coast of Mexico.][[0.0]]
[With favorable environmental conditions, the system quickly organized, becoming a hurricane within 36�hours of forming.][[0.0]]
[Hurricane John continued rapid intensification and reached peak winds of 135�mph -LRB-215�km/h-RRB- on August�30 while just off the Mexican coast.][[0.0]]
[Land interaction weakened the hurricane, and still tracking northwestward it struck the eastern portion of the Baja California peninsula on September�2 as a Category�2 hurricane.][[0.0]]
[John dissipated on September�4, though its remnants brought rainfall to the southwest United States.][[0.0]]
[The last storm to develop in August was Hurricane Kristy, which formed on August�30 about 935�mi -LRB-1505�km-RRB- west-northwest of Hurricane John.][[0.0]]
[It initially tracked northwestward, reaching peak winds of 80�mph -LRB-130�km/h-RRB- within 36�hours of forming.][[0.0]]
[Outflow from Hurricane John caused Kristy to weaken, and at the same time, the storm's motion became nearly stationary as steering currents collapsed.][[0.0]]
[On September�2 it turned to a southeast drift, and degenerated into a tropical depression around the same time.][[0.0]]
[Kristy later turned to the west, oscillating between tropical depression and tropical storm status until dissipating on September�9.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- September Hurricane Lane developed from a tropical wave on September�13 to the south of Mexico.][[0.0]]
[It moved northwestward parallel to the coast of Mexico, and steadily intensified in a favorable environment.][[0.0]]
[After turning to the northeast Lane attained peak winds of 125�mph -LRB-205�km/h-RRB-, and made landfall in the Mexican state of Sinaloa at peak strength.][[0.0]]
[It rapidly weakened and dissipated on September�17, and later brought precipitation to southern Texas.][[0.0]]
[An area of disturbed weather associated with the Intertropical Convergence Zone spawned a tropical depression on September�16 off the coast of Mexico.][[0.0]]
[Despite being disorganized, it quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Miriam.][[0.0]]
[The storm was sheared throughout its duration, and after encountering cooler waters Miriam dissipated on September�18 near the Baja California peninsula.][[0.0]]
[On September�18, an area of disturbed weather in the central Pacific became sufficiently organized and was designated Tropical Depression Two-C.][[0.0]]
[Vertical wind shear caused the depression to weaken into a remnant low on September�20, it never having attained tropical storm status.][[0.0]]
[The depression was initially thought to be a regeneration of earlier Hurricane Kristy.][[0.0]]
[On September�26, another area of disturbed weather in the Central Pacific near the International Date Line became organized and was designated Tropical Depression Three-C.][[0.0]]
[However, wind shear and the presence of dry air to the west inhibited further development, and the system dissipated 12�hours later; at around the same time, the system crossed into the Western Pacific.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- October The first cyclone to develop in the month of October was Tropical Storm Norman, which formed well off the coast of Mexico on October�9.][[1.0]]
[It quickly reached peak winds of 50�mph -LRB-85�km/h-RRB-, though almost as quickly the cyclone degenerated into a remnant low due to wind shear.][[0.0]]
[Its remnants turned to the east, and on October�15 regenerated into a tropical cyclone just off the coast of Mexico after merging with another disturbance.][[0.0]]
[Norman quickly dissipated as unfavorable conditions returned, although it brought heavy rainfall to the Mexican coastline.][[0.0]]
[Tropical Storm Olivia formed on October�9 about 700�mi -LRB-1120�km-RRB- west of Norman.][[0.0]]
[Tracking northeastward and attaining tropical storm status, it failed to strengthen significantly due to wind shear.][[0.0]]

[The strongest hurricane during the month was Hurricane Paul.][[0.0]]
[Forming on October�21, it did not strengthen much initially due to the presence of wind shear.][[0.0]]
[However, a decrease in shear allowed Paul to strengthen rapidly, and in a 24-hour period it developed from a moderate tropical storm to a 105�mph -LRB-170�km/h-RRB- hurricane, its peak intensity.][[0.0]]
[By that time, it had turned northeastward and entered an unfavorable environment, which caused Paul to steadily weaken to tropical storm status.][[0.0]]
[After passing south of the Baja California peninsula it deteriorated to tropical depression status and moved ashore in northwestern Sinaloa.][[0.0]]
[On October�26 shortly after Paul dissipated, another tropical depression formed off the southwest coast of Mexico.][[0.0]]
[Moving southwestward, it encountered unfavorable wind shear, which prevented strengthening.][[0.0]]
[On October�28 it degenerated into a remnant low, and the next day dissipated without affecting land.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Unclassified storm An extratropical storm persisted in the extreme northern central Pacific Ocean in late October.][[0.0]]
[It drifted over unusually warm waters up to 3.6°F -LRB-2°C-RRB- above normal, and gradually developed convection near the center.][[0.0]]
[By November�2, QuikSCAT satellite suggested the system attained winds of up to 60�mph -LRB-95�km/h-RRB- about 900�mi -LRB-1450�km-RRB- west of Oregon.][[0.0]]
[The system also developed an eye and an eyewall.][[0.0]]
[The cyclone tracked northeastward as it gradually weakened, and dissipated on November�4.][[0.0]]
[NASA considered the cyclone to be a subtropical storm.][[0.0]]
[However, as it formed outside of the territory of any monitoring organization, it was not named.][[0.0]]
[Operationally, the United States Navy treated the system as a tropical disturbance, numbered 91C.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- November Tropical activity within the basin in November�2006 was the most active on record, based on the Accumulated Cyclone Energy -LRB-ACE-RRB- Index.][[0.0]]
[Three tropical cyclones formed, of which two became tropical storms; only one other season on record, 1966, produced two tropical storms in the month of November.][[1.0]]
[The first storm of the month was Tropical Storm Rosa, which formed on November�8 as a tropical depression off the southwest coast of Mexico.][[1.0]]
[Immediate development was hampered by wind shear, although an increase in thunderstorms on November�9 brought the depression to tropical storm status.][[0.0]]
[Continued shear prevented intensification, and Rosa dissipated on November�10.][[0.0]]
[Rosa was the first Eastern Pacific tropical storm in November since another storm named Rosa in the 2000 season.][[0.0]]
[On November�11, another tropical depression formed off the coast of Mexico, about 450�mi -LRB-720�km-RRB- west-southwest of where Rosa dissipated the previous day.][[0.0]]
[Similar to Rosa, it developed within an environment with unfavorable wind shear, but failed to intensify beyond tropical depression status.][[0.0]]
[About 18�hours after it formed the depression degenerated into a trough.][[0.0]]
[The final storm of the season was Hurricane Sergio, which was both the strongest and longest-lived November Pacific hurricane on record.][[1.0]]
[It formed on November�13 about 460�mi -LRB-740�km-RRB- south of Manzanillo, Colima, and steadily intensified while tracking southeastward.][[0.0]]
[It reached peak winds of 110�mph -LRB-175�km/h-RRB- on November�15, and subsequently began to weaken due to increased wind shear as it turned to the north.][[0.0]]
[Sergio later turned to the west, remaining well off the coast of Mexico, and dissipated on November�20 about 320�mi -LRB-515�km-RRB- west-northwest of it originally formed.][[0.0]]
[The storm brought light rainfall to the Mexican coastline, though no major effects were reported.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Impact During the season, tropical cyclones collectively caused 14�fatalities and $355�million in damage -LRB-2006�USD-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-nb 1-RSB- With its long coastline, the country of Mexico was affected by ten of the cyclones during the season, including four that made landfall.][[0.0]]
[Of the six storms that affected Mexico but did not strike the country, the first was Tropical Storm Aletta, the first storm of the season, which brought light rainfall and caused minor damage.][[0.0]]
[The next tropical depression of the season produced heavy rainfall in the Acapulco area while remaining offshore; mudslides and flooding were reported, and 72�people were forced to leave their homes.][[0.0]]
[In July, Hurricane Carlotta brushed the coastline with light rainfall.][[0.0]]
[When Tropical Storm Emilia passed just off the coast of Baja California, it brought moderate precipitation which caused minor flooding and damage around Cabo San Lucas.][[0.0]]
[Heavy surf from Hurricane Ileana killed a man near Cabo San Lucas.][[0.0]]
[The last storm of the season, Hurricane Sergio, produced light rainfall along the coast while remaining well offshore.][[0.0]]
[Mexico was struck by four tropical cyclones in 2006, all along the Pacific coast.][[0.0]]
[The first was Hurricane John, which made landfall near the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula on September�1.][[1.0]]
[Earlier, it produced flooding and high surf near Acapulco while paralleling the coastline, and later the hurricane damaged or destroyed at least 450�homes in the Baja California peninsula.][[0.0]]
[Hurricane John was the wettest tropical cyclone of the year in Mexico, dropping 17.7�in -LRB-449�mm-RRB- of rainfall.][[0.0]]
[Five people were killed, and damage in Mexico amounted to $663�million -LRB-2006�MXN, $60.8�million 2006�USD-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Hurricane Lane moved ashore in the state of Sinaloa as a Category�3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale, which was the strongest landfall during the season.][[0.0]]
[Paralleling the coastline a short distance offshore, the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall, causing flooding and mudslides which resulted in four fatalities.][[0.0]]
[Hurricane Lane affected 4,320�houses, and a total of 19,200�mi -LRB-30,000�km-RRB- of roads and highways were damaged to some degree.][[0.0]]
[Monetary damage amounted to about $2.2�billion -LRB-2006�MXN, $203�million 2006�USD-RRB- in damage in the country.][[0.0]]
[In early October, former Tropical Storm Norman passed near or over southwestern Mexico, destroying 20�houses and leaving 20�villages without power.][[0.0]]
[Later, former Hurricane Paul caused four deaths, two of which from rough seas and two from drowning in a flooded river.][[0.0]]
[The storm damaged 5,000�houses, and monetary damage totaled more than $35�million -LRB-2006�MXN, $3.2�million 2006�USD-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Three of the cyclones that affected Mexico also impacted the southwestern United States.][[0.0]]
[Moisture from Tropical Storm Emilia produced thunderstorms in Arizona which caused flooding, and in southern California its rainfall assisted firefighters in combating a wildfire.][[0.0]]
[The remnants of Hurricane John produced moisture across much of the southwestern United States, causing mudslides in California, light rainfall in Arizona, overflowed rivers in New Mexico, and up to 8�in -LRB-200�mm-RRB- of rainfall in Texas.][[0.0]]
[In western Texas, the precipitation was beneficial in some areas but damaging in others, causing flooded roads and washouts.][[0.0]]
[The remnants of Hurricane Lane also produced rainfall in Texas.][[1.0]]
[Four tropical cyclones affected the U.S. state of Hawaii, all of which were the remnants of former tropical cyclones.][[0.0]]
[Moisture from Hurricane Bud produced light rainfall in east-facing slopes of the island chain.][[0.0]]
[Former Hurricane Daniel produced up to 5�in -LRB-125�mm-RRB- of rainfall in the state, though no significant impact was reported.][[0.0]]
[The remnants of Tropical Storm Fabio contributed to heavy rainfall, peaking at 15.08�in -LRB-383�mm-RRB- on Mount Waiʻaleʻale on the island of Kauai; the rainfall caused river and roadway flooding, but little damage.][[0.0]]
[Moisture from Tropical Depression Four-C in October contributed to heavy rainfall on the island of Hawaii.][[0.0]]
[The strongest hurricane of the season was Hurricane Ioke, which reached Category 5 status in the central Pacific Ocean.][[1.0]]
[It first affected the uninhabited Johnston Atoll, although when Ioke struck there was a crew of 12�people taking shelter on the island.][[0.0]]
[Hurricane force winds affected the landmass, powerful enough to knock down trees.][[0.0]]
[In the western Pacific Ocean after being re-classified as a typhoon, Ioke passed near Wake Island, forcing the first full-scale evacuation of the island since a typhoon in 1967.][[0.0]]
[The combination of strong winds and a powerful storm surge damaged 70% of the buildings on the island, many with moderate roof damage.][[0.0]]
[Destruction on the island was estimated at $88�million -LRB-2006�USD-RRB-.][[0.0]]
[Later, the storm passed near the Japanese island of Minami Torishima, which was also fully evacuated; facilities on the island were damaged, although it was repaired and fully operational within three weeks after the storm.][[0.0]]
[The remnants of Ioke later brought hurricane force wind gusts to southwestern Alaska.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Season effects This is a table of the storms in 2006 and their landfall-LRB-s-RRB-, if any; the table does not include storms that did not make landfall, which is defined as the center of the storm moving over a landmass.][[0.0]]
[Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect -LRB-an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident-RRB-, but are still storm-related.][[0.0]]
[Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical or a wave or low.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Storm names The following names were used for named storms that formed in the northeast Pacific in 2006.][[0.0]]
[This is the same list that was used in the 2000 season.][[0.0]]
[There were no names retired from the northeast Pacific list.][[0.0]]
[Therefore, the same list will be reused in the 2012 season.][[0.0]]
[Storms that formed in the central Pacific are given names from a sequential list; in 2006, the name Ioke was used from this list, the first time a name from the Central Pacific list had been used since the 2002 season.][[0.0]]
[-LSB-edit-RSB- Retirement The name Ioke was retired from the north-central Pacific list by the WMO in the spring of 2007 and replaced with Iopa.][[0.0]]
[During the 61st Interdepartmental Hurricane Conference, the Hawaii State Civil Defense requested the retirement of the name Daniel, citing that the storm had become memorable due to threat or damage.][[0.0]]
[However, the request was denied, as the name remains on the tropical cyclone naming list.][[0.0]]
