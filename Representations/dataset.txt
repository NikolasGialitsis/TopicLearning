[Huddersfield chairman Dean Hoyle passed up the opportunity to sign Rickie Lambert for just £750,000 in 2009 as his age 'didn't represent good value for money'.][[1]]
[The England international was a target for Huddersfield in 2008-09 before he joined Southampton from Bristol Rovers, which led to a £4million return to his boyhood club Liverpool this summer.][[0]]
[Although the 32-year-old is almost certain to be part of England's World Cup squad, Hoyle decided not to pursue the club's interest in Lambert at the time.][[1]]
[VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Lambert's first interview as a Liverpool player][[0]]
[No regrets? Huddersfield turned down the chance to sign Rickie Lambert for just £750,000 in 2009][[1]]
[Oops! Dean Hoyles didn't sign Lambert from Bristol Rovers because he wasn't 'good value for money'][[0]]
[Speaking to the Huddersfield Examiner on July 7, 2009, Hoyle said: 'A move for Rickie Lambert is a no-no.][[0]]
['No disrespect to a very good player, but it’s a simple matter of economics. Any deal would cost a minimum of £750,000 plus add-ons for a player who is 27 and who would want a three-year contract.][[0]]
['Even if he scored 30 goals a season for those three years, by the time the contract is at an end, the player would be 30, and therefore there would be little or no resale value.][[0]]
[Red alert! Lambert has since completed a £4million move to his boyhood club Liverpool][[0]]
['That means that even before meeting wage demands, the signing would cost £5,000 a week, and this club cannot do that kind of business.][[0]]
['If Rickie Lambert was 22 or 23, it would be a different matter, but he’s not and suggestions that we will sign him are nonsense.'][[0]]
[The Huddersfield chairman may regret those words after seeing Lambert complete his dream move to Liverpool where he will be challenging for the Premier League title while playing in the Champions League next season.][[1]]

[Inside are several articles about the state of the United Kingdom][[1]]
[For someone so beautiful, this isn't pretty.][[0]]
[The face of the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton,  has been slapped on the front of a U.S. magazine with a set of yellow, decaying teeth.][[0]]
[The Royal was PhotoShopped like the American stereotype of a Brit with bad gnashers for a special issue of the politics and arts publication The New Republic about the future of Britain.][[1]]

[The 30-year-old, who is expected to attend Sunday's Wimbledon tennis final, appears in front of a tattered Union Jack alongside the words, 'Something's Rotten. The Last Days of Britain.'][[0]]
[Inside are several articles about the state of the United Kingdom ahead of this summer's Olympics which have sparked outrage online.][[0]]
[Last year the pearly white Duchess spent thousands of pounds having her teeth polished and turned to give her the perfect smile.][[0]]
[French dentist Didier Fillion used a][[0]]
[hidden brace to make Kate’s teeth appear a little out of line,][[0]]
[un-American and therefore beautifully natural.][[0]]
[The Duchess of Cambridge looked radiant as she watched the tennis at Wimbledon's Centre Court this week][[0]]
['He did some little micro-rotations][[0]]
[on Kate,' his dentist Bernard Touati revealed. 'That’s why they look so][[0]]
[good – because they are not perfectly aligned.][[0]]
['The problem in the United States is][[0]]
[they have very artificial vision. But what we like is a natural healthy][[0]]

[Dr Fillion, also an expert in][[0]]
[polishing and whitening teeth, has a clinic in London’s Wimpole Street][[0]]
[as well as in Paris and Geneva.][[0]]
[Creating the perfect smile can take the Frenchman anything from six months to two years and costs from £4,000 to £11,000.][[0]]
[Brits having bad teeth is a staple of American humour about the UK. For example, in one episode of the hot comedy The Simpsons Lisa was shown The Big Book of British Teeth by her orthodontist.][[0]]
[One commenter said: 'Not cool. I am not an imperialist (not even close!), but she seems to be][[0]]
[a genuine person. She is young, beautiful, and privileged. Apparently][[0]]

[Ed Balls claimed £1,610 for cleaners without providing any receipts][[1]]
[Ed Balls and a string of Labour frontbenchers claimed expenses for cleaning and other odd jobs without submitting receipts, it has emerged.][[0]]
[Mr Balls claimed £1,610 for cleaners and his wife Yvette Cooper claimed £2,640 for housework and gardening, out of a total of £37,881 claimed by 12 Labour MPs.][[1]]
[But the shadow chancellor did not submit a single receipt for the work done – despite telling families they had a duty to record the personal details of gardeners, cleaners and handymen, no matter how small the job done.][[0]]
[It also emerged that Mr Balls and his wife Yvette Cooper have never asked their window cleaner in Castleford, West Yorkshire, for a receipt despite employing him for nearly two decades.][[0]]
[Pontefract Window Cleaning Services last night confirmed it had never been asked for a receipt by Mr Balls. The firm cleans the windows at the three-storey Balls family home once a month, charging £12 each time.][[0]]
[Bur a spokesman for Mr Balls insisted his practice of demanding receipts applied only to jobs where he pays in cash.][[0]]
[He pointed out that Mr Balls pays his window cleaner by cheque and receives handwritten invoices every few months.][[0]]
[He also defended the cleaning claims. He said: 'Ed's cleaner was and continues to be employed on PAYE and paid by bank transfer. These claims were made fully in accordance with the Fees Office rules.'][[0]]
[On Sunday Mr Balls said even someone who 'cuts your hedge for a tenner' should provide an invoice to discourage tax avoidance.][[0]]
[Mr Balls said he had the 'name and address and a receipt' for every cash transaction because it was 'the right thing to do'.][[0]]
[David Cameron this morning said he wanted Mr Balls 'to have more time to clean his own windows and cut his own hedge' – by defeating Labour at the next election.][[1]]
[Yesterday he insisted that it was fine to pay for goods and services without asking for a receipt – because the onus was on the tradesman to pay his or her taxes.][[0]]
[Mr Cameron said he had occasionally paid things in cash without getting a receipt, but insisted that he has never helped someone 'evade the taxes that they should pay'.][[1]]
[John Durning (right) from Castleford, West Yorkshire, cleans Mr Balls's windows at his home in Castleford, West Yorkshire][[0]]
[A Downing Street spokesman said: 'The onus is on the trader who is responsible for paying the taxes that they owe.'][[0]]
[Mr Cameron's intervention came after Labour's shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said getting a receipt for all cash-in-hand jobs was a 'matter of good housekeeping' and was a 'good thing to do'.][[0]]
[The Tories said Labour's suggestion that families should always get a receipt for cash-in-hand jobs revealed a 'complete lack of understanding' about business.][[1]]
[Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said it was 'absurd'.][[0]]
[He said: 'I don't think anybody in the country probably does that unless they sit down and they do it as part of a process; in other words, if you are employing somebody in which the objective is paying them cash as a process of your business, then of course I suspect most businesses do keep some kind of record, that's the right thing to do.][[0]]
['But if you have a one-off payment for something and you pay cash, I shouldn't think anybody in the country does that necessarily ... what it exemplifies is Labour's complete lack of understanding about how business works and, actually, how people get by.'][[0]]
[Charlotte Leslie promised to hand back cash from a businessman accused of tax-avoidance][[0]]
[Conservative Party high command was accused of intervening to stop a Tory MP handing back a donation from a businessman accused of tax avoidance.][[0]]
[Charlotte Leslie pledged on Monday to return £5,000 given by Hugh Sloane, the multimillionaire co-founder of an investment management company, Sloane Robinson. A tribunal had ruled that the firm had operated a tax avoidance scheme.][[0]]
[The MP for Bristol North West originally told The Times: 'Nobody wants to take money that's not whiter than white.'][[0]]
[But just hours later, she retracted the promise. A party source said: 'Charlotte realised she had made a mistake. She realised she had to change her position.'][[0]]
[Last night a Labour MP wrote to Miss Leslie to ask her whether she had been pressurised into the U-turn following arm-twisting from Tory Central Office.][[0]]
[Phil Wilson pointed out that Mr Sloane and his business associate had given the Conservative Party as a whole almost £1million. If Miss Leslie had handed her donation back, it would have put pressure on the whole party to do the same.][[0]]
[The issue highlights the thorny issue of political donations. Labour say the Tories are too dependent on 'dodgy' financiers for funding, while the Conservatives say Labour are in hock to the unions.][[0]]
[Miss Leslie received the personal donation from Mr Sloane in December.][[0]]
[His company, Sloane Robinson, was ordered to pay £13million in unpaid tax and national insurance contributions to HM Revenue and Customs in 2012 after a tribunal ruled against a tax scheme it had since 2004.][[0]]
[The Crown argued that the share scheme was 'nothing more than the mechanism for the delivery of bonuses' of £24million to Mr Sloane; George Robinson, the company's co-founder; and two other directors.][[0]]
[The tribunal presiding on the case concluded that the structures under investigation were 'merely money-box companies serving an essentially mechanical purpose.'][[0]]
[Mr Sloane has also given donations of £10,000 each to Angie Bray, the Tory MP for Ealing Central and Action; and Nicola Blackwood, Tory MP for Oxford West and Abingdon. The pair, who are both defending marginal seats, do not intend to return the money.][[0]]

[The badly decomposed body of an elderly woman has been discovered in her flat where she lay undiscovered for six years.][[1]]
[Anne Leitrim, who was in her 70s, had not been seen since 2008 and neighbours had assumed she moved out of the area because her home appeared empty.][[1]]
[Incredibly, two windows to the ground floor flat had remained opened in all that time.][[0]]
[Shocking: The body of a pensioner lay undiscovered in a Bournemouth house for six years, as neighbours assumed she'd moved out of the area][[1]]
[Access: Incredibly, Mrs Leitrim's body lay undiscovered despite windows to the property being open][[0]]
[Mrs Leitrim's modest home is in a block of eight flats and even backs on to a communal garden that is regularly used.][[0]]
[Residents at the flats in Bournemouth, Dorset, joked it looked so abandoned there could be a body in it, unaware Mrs Leitrim was dead inside.][[0]]
[Her remains were finally found when bailiffs visited the property in the 1980s-built block to collect unpaid debts.][[0]]
[After getting no answer at the door they got into the property through one of the open windows and made the grim discovery.][[0]]
[Shocked neighbours have spoken of feeling guilty that it had taken such a long period of time for anyone to realise Mrs Leitrim was dead.][[0]]
[They described her as being friendly and softly spoken with a Scottish accent.][[0]]
[John Stanley, 55, who has lived in the building in the Throop area of Bournemouth for the eight years, said: ‘Everyone is so shocked.][[0]]
[Tragic: Anne Leitrim, who was in her 70s, had not been seen since 2008][[0]]
[‘We didn't think anyone was living in the flat. Her car went and we just thought she had moved out.][[0]]
[‘There are cobwebs in the windows and we used to joke there could be a body inside but we had no idea.][[0]]
[‘When the bailiffs and locksmiths came to the flat they entered the property through two windows that had been left ajar.][[0]]
[‘The windows were slightly open and they used a coat hanger to get inside.][[0]]
[‘The locksmith went in and said 'I think there's a body'. It was so decomposed he couldn't tell.’][[0]]
[Shock: Neighbours including Ruth Evans (left) and Debbie Small (right) have spoke of their horror at the discovery][[0]]
[Ruth Evans, 59, who has lived in the building for six years, added: ‘It makes me feel guilty. You think of all the times we were out in the garden and she was just lying there.][[0]]
[‘When her car disappeared we all thought she had moved away. When I heard there was a body inside I couldn't believe it.’][[0]]
[Debbie Small, who has lived in the same street for two years, said: ‘It is really sad. It is a really friendly street and we all know each other. I can't believe it.’][[0]]
[Neighbour Mr Stanley said: 'Bailiffs arrived on Tuesday because she had been defaulting on her mortgage payments since May last year.][[0]]
['It turned out she had been making automatic payments from her bank account for four years after she died.][[0]]
['To think she has been lying there all this time is heartbreaking.][[0]]
['She was lying on the floor next to the bed with her hand over her chest. They think she probably had a heart attack.'][[0]]
[Mr Stanley revealed the residents of the other flats in the block held garden parties right outside Mrs Lietrim's flat without realising she lay dead.][[0]]
[He added: 'It is absolutely tragic and has left us all in shock. She used to keep herself to herself and no-one really knew her very well.][[0]]
['She drove a red car and then one day it just wasn't here any more. We all assumed she had moved out and didn't think any more about it.][[0]]
['I'd never seen any family or friends visiting her, and the only person who ever approached her door was the postman.][[0]]
[Last year TV presenter Esther Rantzen set up the charity The Silver Line - a free phoneline for old people who are lonely.][[0]]
[A spokesman for the charity said it was a 'sad and shocking' case.][[0]]
[Charity Contact the Elderly, which says it offers a vital lifeline of friendship to those aged 75 and over, who live alone, said it has declared a state-of-emergency in the UK as the number of socially isolated older people reaches breaking point.][[0]]
[A new study conducted by Qa Research reveals that almost one in five (19 per cent) of the older people Contact the Elderly supports joined the charity because they rarely saw another person.][[0]]
[Contact the Elderly Founder and Chairman, Trevor Lyttleton MBE, said: 'Loneliness amongst older people has reached a state of emergency and must not be ignored. For almost 50 years we have been focussing on providing a cost-effective solution, yet the demand for our service has never been so high.][[0]]
['We know our formula of tea and conversation works, but we simply cannot reach out to the people that desperately need our help without increased volunteers and funding.'][[0]]
[A spokesman for Bournemouth coroner's office said formal identification of the body had not taken place.][[0]]
[They said a post mortem examination will be attempted but it is highly unlikely to identify a cause of death.][[0]]
[It is thought they have been in contact with Mrs Leitrim's next of kin.][[0]]
[A spokesman from Dorset Police said the death is not being treated as suspicious.][[0]]

[The American Ebola victims have said they would not hesitate to treat patients with the virus again.][[0]]
[Dr. Kent Brantly, Nancy Writebol, Dr. Rick Sacra, Amber Vinson, Nina Pham and Ashoka Mukpo appeared on the Today show on Tuesday morning for their first ever joint interview.][[1]]
[They were not joined by Dr Craig Spencer, a Doctors Without Borders physician who was diagnosed with the virus after returning to New York City from Guinea. He was released earlier this month.][[1]]
[Most of the group had been working with Ebola victims in West Africa or in the U.S. when they contracted Ebola, but when asked if they would do the same again, it was unanimous 'yes'.][[1]]
[All smiles: Ebola survivors (from left) Amber Vinson, Dr. Kent Brantly, Nina Pham, Nancy Writebol, Dr. Rick Sacra and Ashoka Mukpo appeared on the Today show on Tuesday for their first ever joint interview][[0]]
['Nursing is a calling and it's such a rewarding career,' said Nina Pham, who contracted the virus while treating a patient in Dallas, Texas. 'It's in our personalities and our nature to help.'][[0]]
[Ashoka Mukpo, an NBC News video journalist who contracted Ebola while working in Liberia, quipped: 'I wish I had used a little bit more chlorine.'][[0]]
[Writebol, who contracted the virus in July while on a missionary trip to Liberia, added that she would even 'possibly' return to carry out further aid work.][[0]]
[Dr Sacra, a married dad-of-three who also contracted the virus in Liberia, agreed he would return.][[0]]
[A few of the former patients - Dr. Rick Sacra,  Nina Pham and Ashoka Mukpo - had fought the virus after getting plasma donations from Dr. Brantly.][[0]]
[For more video, please go to Today][[0]]
[No regrets: The survivors told Matt Lauer, left, that they would treat Ebola victims again in the future][[0]]
[Brantly, 33, and Writebol, 59, were both in Liberia when they contracted Ebola and were flown back to Emory Hospital in Atlanta, where they both recovered and were released.][[0]]
[Brantly's blood was then used to cure other patients.][[0]]
['I just want to say thank you,' Mukpo said to Brantly on Today. 'It's a good opportunity to express my appreciation for what you did. It's just amazing that you gave so much to all of us.'][[0]]
[Pham added: 'He's a selfless man and he's like our angel. He gave us a second chance at life.'][[0]]
[But Brantly responded with characteristic modesty, saying: 'I think God saved my life and I have a responsibility to use my life in a way that is glorifying to Him and helpful to other people.][[0]]
[Together: Amber Vinson, a nurse who contracted Ebola in Texas, shared new photos of her with her fiance][[1]]
[Happy: Vinson and her fiance, Derrick Markray, smile as they show off her new engagement ring, which she was given for free by a Dallas jewelers; her first ring was destroyed after her diagnosis][[0]]
['It was an honor and a privilege but also just a natural thing to help others.'][[0]]
[His blood had not proved a match with that of Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person in the U.S. to be diagnosed with Ebola and who later died. Pham and Vinson contracted Ebola while treating him.][[0]]
[Another high-profile survivor was Pham's dog Bentley, a King Charles Cavalier Spaniel, who was put in quarantine after concerns he might have contracted Ebola.][[0]]
[But he showed no traces of the virus and has now been reunited with Pham, 26.][[0]]
['He gets more questions than people ask about me,' she said, laughing. 'He just celebrated his second birthday.'][[0]]
[She and the other survivors said that while some people had been extremely supportive following their diagnoses, they had also been bombarded with abuse from others, who deemed them careless.][[0]]
[Reunited: Nina Pham's dog Bentley, who was put into quarantine, has just celebrated his second birthday][[0]]
[Back together: Dr Kent Brantly, 33, has also been reunited with his wife Amber and their two young children][[1]]
['There's been a lot of scrutiny,' Dr. Rick Sacra, 51, said. 'We've all been under a magnifying glass or under a microscope for the past couple of months. There's a lot of criticism on social media that you see.'][[0]]
[Recovered: They were not joined by Dr Craig Spencer, who was diagnosed with Ebola in NYC][[0]]
[They agreed that they believe some people will always keep their distance from them - with Mukpo quipping that he believes they'll get pretty good seats on future plane journeys.][[0]]
[Another former patient to receive criticism was Vinson, who contracted the virus while working in Dallas and then - unaware she had it - flew to Ohio to plan her wedding before returning to Texas.][[0]]
[The 29-year-old has previously said she would never have boarded the planes if she felt ill.][[0]]
[Now she is looking forward to marrying her fiance, and shared photographs with the Today show of them together in front of their Christmas tree.][[0]]
['It gave me hope [that other people had survived],' she said.][[0]]
['I knew that it was a struggle but.. [medical staff] told me there would be rough days but there are others who have made it through.'][[0]]
[At the conclusion of the interview, the group expressed their thanks to family, friends and strangers who have offered their support over the past few months.][[0]]
[Mukpo added: 'I'm thankful for all the brave men and women in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone who put their lives at risk to deal with this epidemic. They're the real heroes.'][[0]]

[Eddie, who is the oldest heart transplant survivor in the country, tripped over the sign after it was left lying flat in the middle of a road near his waterfront apartment.][[0]]
[However, instead of falling on to the ground, he landed on the sign's upturned hinged stand which holds it in position.][[0]]
[He was taken to Bristol Royal Infirmary, where his collapsed lung triggered pancreatitis - an inflammation of the pancreas which can prove fatal.][[0]]
[Praise: The comedian said Bristol Royal Infirmary's nurses and doctors provided an 'amazing' level of care][[0]]
[He was also diagnosed with pneumonia, and suffered an allergic reaction to the painkillers he was given.][[0]]

[Right down to the thick-rimmed glasses, expressions and perfect comic timing, the likeness is uncanny.][[0]]
[And if it weren’t for the fact that Morecambe and Wise are sadly no longer with us, these two men would surely pass for them every single time.][[0]]
[Jonty Stephens and Ian Ashpitel have been given the daunting task of ‘resurrecting’ Britain’s best-loved comedy duo for this month’s Edinburgh Festival.][[1]]
[Uncanny: Jonty Stephens (left) and Ian Ashpitel (right) not only look and sound identical to the duo, but their mannerisms and delivery are pitch perfect][[0]]
[The originals: The show at Edinburgh Festival aims to bring back the 'feel, look and sound' of an evening with Ernie Wise (left) and Eric Morecambe (right)][[0]]
[Those who have seen them in action are astonished that they not only look and sound identical to the twosome, but their mannerisms and delivery are also spot on.][[0]]
[Their show, Eric and Little Ern, re-enacts the finest moments during their 42-year partnership, which ended with Eric Morecambe’s death in 1984.][[0]]
[It is set in 1999, when Ernie Wise is close to death in hospital after having two heart attacks while on holiday.][[0]]
[While he dozes, a white-coated doctor walks in - and turns out to be none other than the spirit of his old pal Eric.][[0]]
[Somehow, he manages to coax ‘little Ern’ off his sickbed and into a re-enactment of some of their finest showbiz moments.][[0]]
[The show, written and performed by Stephens and Ashpitel, aims to bring to life the ‘feel, look and sound’ of an evening with Eric and Ernie.][[0]]
[It combines much-loved sketches with additional original material by scriptwriters Eddie Braben, Sid Green and Dick Hills as well as some biographical details.][[0]]
[Highlights: Morecambe and Wise cosy up to actress Penelope Keith. The show recreates their greatest comedy moments in a series of flashbacks from Ernie Wise's death bed][[1]]
[Chemistry: Their talent and affection for each other jumped off the screen, whether it was dressing up with Glenda Jackson (left) or acting the fool in the opening gambit to their show (right)][[0]]
[Ashpitel and Stephens say their own friendship, spanning back several decades, helps them recreate the chemistry of that incomparable duo.][[0]]
[They also suggest it helps that Ashpitel, who plays Wise, ‘just happens to have short, fat, hairy legs’.][[0]]
[The pair first met at drama school 30 years ago and recently created this show from a shorter, after-dinner sketch they were already performing.][[0]]
[Individually they have a wide variety of stage and television credits ranging from BBC drama to Shakespeare’s Globe.][[0]]
[Morecambe and Wise met as teenagers in 1941 and took part in a series of children’s variety performances before launching as a comedy duo.][[0]]

[Ireland will be forced to 'take it a little bit easy' in training on Monday, counting the cost of playing 'one-and-a-quarter Test matches' in their 23-16 defeat to Wales.][[0]]
[Head coach Joe Schmidt conceded he would hand his shattered players extra time to recover as Ireland come to terms with their 'straight-up' lesson in failing to convert pressure into tries.][[0]]
[Ireland can still win the RBS 6 Nations on points difference if they beat Scotland in Edinburgh handsomely on Saturday, despite blowing their Grand Slam chances in Wales.][[1]]
[Ireland are feeling the strain after a narrow defeat to Wales that ended their Grand Slam chances][[1]]
[VIDEO Wales dash Ireland's Grand Slam hopes][[0]]
[Kiwi boss Schmidt believes the carrot of retaining the championship title for the first time since 1949 will allow Ireland to shake off their frustrations from Saturday's Millennium Stadium loss.][[0]]
['Probably Monday we might have to take it a little bit easy on the back of there being a lot of ball in play,' said Schmidt, who confirmed no new injury worries.][[0]]
['There were a lot of long phases of play, we probably played one-and-a-quarter Test matches in the context of some of the other Tests we've played.][[0]]
['And there's a lesson we've got straight-up - if you're going to play like that then you've got to be able to keep going in those moments that you do get pressure on them.][[0]]
['The players all left the field able to play, but they'll have some bruises for sure which will limit anything we do (on Monday).'][[0]]
[Ireland's starkest lesson from Saturday's aborted Grand Slam bid surrounded killer instinct, or the lack of it.][[0]]
[Former Leinster boss Schmidt has already admitted Ireland 'didn't achieve anything' by expecting to see off Wales by accumulating penalties in Cardiff.][[0]]
[Joe Schmidt admitted there were plenty of tired bodies in the Irish camp, and said he would take things easy][[1]]
[Ireland, Wales and England can all still now claim the Six Nations title, but Schmidt continued to warn his side about being sidetracked by trying to gauge what points difference could secure further glory.][[0]]
['We learned from those 10 wins and we will learn from this loss as well,' said Schmidt, after Ireland suffered their first loss since 13-10 defeat to England in last year's Six Nations.][[0]]
['What we can learn is that we won't lack for character, we don't lack for endeavour and those are important starting points.][[0]]
['What we do know is we are still in the championship and we still have a fantastic opportunity to do something that hasn't been done for a long time if we can create enough opportunities in Murrayfield next week.][[0]]
[The match against Wales was a bruising encounter, with Ireland failing to take their chances][[0]]
['But if you go looking for differentials without first of all making sure you have targeted the result, you are going to make it a pretty tough day for yourself.'][[0]]
[Schmidt admitted he will push his Ireland side to sharpen up their attacking accuracy this week in a bid to combat the blunt edge that emerged against Wales.][[0]]
['It's funny because people were talking about us not making enough line breaks, not making enough passes, even though we'd obviously made more than any other team and I think that would definitely be true after Saturday,' said Schmidt.][[0]]
['I felt we showed fantastic endeavour, but that accuracy is what we're going to need and that's what we'll work on this week,][[0]]
['We didn't quite get our rhythm and if you don't quite get that right against a defensive side that Wales have, particularly their ability to be very physical.][[0]]
['I felt we did a lot of that right, but not enough of it right to convert it into points.'][[0]]

[She proved a match for Nazi Germany when she broke Hitler’s codes at Bletchley Park, so Lord King of Bridgwater should have known better than to comment on the advancing years of Baroness Trumpington of Sandwich.][[0]]
[The formidable 89-year-old Conservative life peer was unimpressed when her relatively junior colleague gestured towards her to illustrate his point about the extreme age of World War II veterans.][[0]]
[Lady Trumpington hit back against his patronising reference with a distinctly unparliamentary gesture of her own - commonly known as the two-finger salute and reminiscent of Winston Churchill's famed V for Victory' sign.][[1]]
[Two-finger salute: Baroness Trumpington gestures towards Lord King of Bridgwater to show just what she thinks of colleagues making reference to her age][[1]]
[Inspiration? Was Baroness Trumpington mimicking Winston Churchill's][[0]]
[famed 'V for victory' gesture'?][[0]]
[The extraordinary scene unfolded while Lord King was making a speech about the passing of the wartime generation during the Remembrance Day debate in the Lords on Thursday.][[0]]
[Lady Trumpington appeared to be minding her own business peering down at some papers over her spectacles as the former Defence Secretary paid tribute to veterans of the first World War who had ‘gradually faded away’.][[0]]
[Then turning towards Lady Trumpington, Lord King, 78, raised his arm towards her and continued: ‘And then the survivors of World War II started to look pretty old as well. As my noble friend, the Baroness, reminds me.'][[0]]
[At this point, Lady Trumpington glared at him with disdain, raised two fingers at him to signal ‘up yours’, and then went back to studying her notes.][[0]]
[The exchange instantly became an internet hit with viewers describing the former chain-smoking Lady Trumpington – known by colleagues as ‘Trumpers’ - as a ‘heroine’.][[0]]
[Extraordinary: The clash between the two peers took place on Thursday when Lord King was making a speech in a Remembrance Day debate in the Lords][[0]]
[Lady Trumpington, formerly Jean Alys Barker, yesterday claimed that the gesture was not intentional and insisted her hand must have ‘flown up’ accidentally.][[0]]
[She told the Daily Mail: ‘I didn’t mean to make the gesture. My hand must have flown up. I have never been offended by Lord King. I don’t remember doing it.’][[0]]
[Born in 1922, Lady Trumpington was also a former Mayor of Cambridge. Between 1989 to 1992, she was a minister of state at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food – which, at the age of 69, made her the oldest woman minister ever.][[0]]
[Codebreaker: The Baroness helped to crack Hitler's codes at Bletchley Park during the 1940s][[0]]
[In 2005, she was made a Dame Commander of the Royal Victorian Order. As a  Baroness-in-Waiting she was a member of the Royal Household.][[0]]
[A former 70-a-day smoker, Lady Trumpington is well-liked by colleagues for her wicked sense of humour and straight-talking.][[0]]
[During a debate on equality, Lady Trumpington sent peers into gales of laughter by revealed that booking into a hotel used to give a ‘certain frisson’ as her late husband had to use a different name.][[0]]
[When she was a guest on Desert Island Discs, she chose the Crown jewels as her luxury item, in order to maximise her chances of being rescued.][[0]]
[Lord King last night insisted that the pair were ‘old friends’ and that Lady Trumpington had been joking with him when she made the gesture.][[0]]
[He said: ‘We had been joking together before we went into the chamber.][[0]]
[‘She is a wonderful person and was the only person in the chamber who had been in the second World War and was taking part in the debate.][[0]]
[‘She made some sort of gesture. I think it must have been my reference to her age. But there is absolutely no ill feeling between us at all. She is a very old friend of mine.][[0]]
[‘She went on to make a wonderful contribution to the debate and was on very good form. It is rather frightening that this is now all over the internet. I hope nobody thinks I was offending her.’][[0]]
[Well-liked: The Baroness is popular among her peers for her wicked sense of humour and straight-talking][[0]]
[Lord King served in the Cabinet from 1983 until 1992 and was appointed Defence Secretary under Prime Minister John Major during the Gulf War.][[0]]
[He left the Cabinet after the 1992 general election, and returned to the backbenches where he served as Chairman of the Intelligence and Security Select Committee from 1994-2001. He was made a life peer in 2001.][[0]]
[One comment on the website Total Politics said: ‘My headmaster's wife way back in the 60s, and a formidable battleaxe back then. Bless her. Lord Blagger - up yours. She's a fine woman who has had an illustrious career in the Lords for many many years.’][[0]]
[Another added: ‘Surely it was a reference to Churchill’s victory gesture?’][[0]]

[United Airlines customers were left furious on Wednesday evening after the company announced that it would be voiding all tickets which were sold at hugely discounted rates because of an online glitch.][[0]]
[The error, which was first identified by customers on Wednesday morning, saw first class, round-trip, transatlantic flights on offer for as little as $74, provided travelers registered themselves as being located in Denmark.][[1]]
[But, eight hours after the error was first spotted, the airline dashed the hopes of thousands of holidaymakers after refusing to honor any bookings made as a result of the online glitch, blaming a 'third-party error' for the mistake and accusing customers of trying to 'take advantage' of the situation.][[0]]
[For a brief period of time on February 11, round-trip, first class fares from London to Newark were available on United.com for just $74][[0]]
[Null and void: United issued a statement on Wednesday evening which said that the airline would refuse to honor bookings made during the website glitch][[1]]
['United is voiding the bookings of several thousand individuals who were attempting to take advantage of an error a third-party software provider made when it applied an incorrect currency exchange rate, despite United having properly filed its fares,' a statement issued by the airline said.][[0]]
['Most of these bookings were for travel originating in the United Kingdom, and the level of bookings made with Danish Kroner as the local currency was significantly higher than normal during the limited period that customers made these bookings.'][[0]]
[The airline's announcement, which was released via its official Twitter account at approximately 6.20pm EST, prompted a flurry of irate replies from hundreds of disappointed customers.][[0]]
[A number of holidaymakers accused the company of violating the Department of Transportation's (DOT) regulations regarding airline travel, while others threatened to pursue legal action against United, particularly those who had received confirmation emails from the company hours earlier.][[0]]
['Get ready for a couple of thousand DOT complaints,' one user wrote, while another added: 'So you f****d up and are retracting legal contracts?! See you in court!'][[0]]
[Outrage: Customers were quick to vent their frustration on Twitter with many threatening to pursue legal action against the airline][[0]]
[Ruined reputation: Many questioned why the airline would risk destroying its credibility for the sake of saving money][[0]]
[Several other customers merely voiced their frustration and anger at the situation, with many accusing United of ruining their eagerly-anticipated holidays.][[0]]
['Fine. But you have to tell my kids we're not going to NY this summer,' a disappointed parent tweeted, while a second person promised to boycott the airline in the future, saying: 'I have been a @united customer for over a decade. That might come to an end now.'][[0]]
[The error on the website was first spotted this morning at around 10am EST, with a number of eagle-eyed travelers taking to Twitter to spread the word about the glitch which saw travelers offered return, first class flights from London to New York for just $74.][[1]]
[The round-trip first class tickets from Heathrow to Newark, just outside of New York City, were snatched up by lucky holidaymakers for just 491 Danish krone due to an apparent error on the site.][[0]]
[By registering as a customer in Denmark, holidaymakers could snap up the deal, which would normally set them back between $5,618 and $6,778.][[0]]
[Bargain! The unbelievable fare totaled 491 Danish krone, which comes to $74][[0]]
[It is unclear how the deal happened and it appears United quickly made changes to prevent anyone else from purchasing the cheap tickets.][[0]]
[One customer who snapped up the bargain fare said she simply logged on to United.com and changed her country status to Denmark.][[0]]
[She then chose her dates and made sure to select business class or first class from the drop down menu.][[0]]
[Then, using a credit card without a foreign transaction fee, the purchase was completed and a confirmation email sent, although the customer did say she left her country as 'Denmark' when filling out her postal address.][[0]]
[Despite the low costs, two customers reported finding 'miscellaneous' charges from the airline on their debit or credit card statements - which they believed to be an additional booking fee of $40 per ticket - meaning the total price of their tickets was closer to $100 each.][[0]]
[A second customer secured first class transatlantic flights for a total of 1,356DKK - around $206 or £135][[0]]
[Both customers said that they were happy to pay the additional amount however, as the price still worked out much cheaper than a full price first class ticket.][[0]]
[Daily Mail Online attempted to secure the same deal at approximately 16:20 GMT, but found that selecting Denmark from the country drop down menu was no longer an option.][[0]]
[The country option was then turned back to the original country of origin, which was in this case the United Kingdom.][[0]]
[In an earlier statement provided to MailOnline Travel, a spokesperson for the company said: 'United has temporarily suspended sales from its Denmark website because a third-party software provider applied an incorrect exchange rate and was misquoting the airline’s properly filed fares.][[0]]
['This error in the application of the exchange rate primarily impacted individuals who live outside of Denmark and who were not traveling to or from Denmark but were attempting to book tickets using United’s Denmark site.'][[0]]

[The BBC hands out 25,000 contracts a year that can help its workers pay less tax, MPs reveal today.][[0]]
[The off-the-books arrangements create ‘suspicions of complicity in tax avoidance’, according to Commons spending watchdog Margaret Hodge.][[0]]
[The workers include 4,500 presenters and backroom employees paid through ‘personal service companies’ that allow them to limit substantially their tax liabilities.][[1]]
[Arrangement: BBC stars Fiona Bruce and Jeremy Paxman have both set up private service companies in order to be paid, but said that it was not their choice. The BBC is reported to hand out 25,000 contract a year so its stars can pay less tax][[1]]
[That figure – revealed by the BBC last night – is much higher than previously thought and covers 400 stars paid at least £50,000 a year.][[0]]
[Of these, 148 are news presenters such as Fiona Bruce and Jeremy Paxman.][[0]]
[Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander told the Daily Mail he expected the corporation to take ‘swift and decisive action’ to address public concern about the tax arrangements.][[0]]
[Thirteen thousand of the off-the-books contracts are for on-air roles. The BBC stressed that most are normal freelance contracts, rather than personal service company deals.][[0]]
[The corporation, which said the 25,000 figure includes individuals with multiple contracts, has launched an internal review into the issue, while insisting it has done nothing wrong.][[0]]
[Shock: Margaret Hodge said that the practice happens in other public sector areas and is almost always 'staggeringly inappropriate'][[0]]
[But MPs last night said they were shocked by the scale of the issue at the BBC. In a damning report, the Commons public accounts committee said it was alarmed the Corporation could not ‘provide any assurance that these individuals are paying the correct amount of tax’.][[1]]
[Mrs Hodge, the chairman of the committee, said the practice, which has been uncovered elsewhere in the public sector, ‘generates suspicions of complicity in tax avoidance and fails to meet the standards expected of public officials’.][[0]]
[The Labour MP added: ‘We were shocked to discover that the BBC has about 25,000 off-payroll contracts. Some 13,000 of these are for individuals who are on our screens and on the radio every day. They are the public face of the BBC.][[0]]
[‘Avoiding tax and national insurance when paying public sector staff is almost always staggeringly inappropriate.][[0]]
[‘The public sector must maintain the highest standards of propriety in its employment practices if it is to show leadership in the fight against tax avoidance.’][[0]]
[Mr Alexander ordered a crackdown on the use of personal service companies in the public sector after it emerged that 2,400 senior civil servants were employed in this way.][[0]]
[As an independent organisation, the BBC is beyond the scope of the Treasury review, but Mr Alexander has written to the Corporation’s new director-general George Entwistle asking him to follow suit. He told the Mail: ‘We took swift and decisive action to improve tax transparency in central government. I see no reason why, just like we have in central government, the BBC shouldn’t be able to provide assurance that its employees are paying the proper amount of tax and NI.][[0]]
[The BBC is beyond the scope of a treasury review into the practice but Mr Alexander has written to the new Director General George Entwhistle asking him to crack down on personal service companies][[1]]
[‘With a new broom at the top of the BBC there is an opportunity to look again at this issue. I look forward to seeing the findings of their review.’][[0]]
[So far the BBC has moved just two workers on to its  payroll as a result of its investigations.][[0]]
[Those employed through personal service companies are responsible for ensuring they pay the right amount of tax and national insurance because it is not deducted from their salary at source.][[0]]
[Unlike normal freelance contracts there is no liability against the BBC if a mistake is made.][[0]]
[MPs heard evidence that the BBC requires some on-screen stars to set up these arrangements – a claim disputed by the corporation.][[0]]
[Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander told the Daily Mail he expected the BBC to take 'swift and decisive action' to address public concern about the tax arrangements][[0]]
[The BBC denies that the arrangement reduces its tax bill or that of top stars. It claims the practice is standard in the industry and reflects the fact that many presenters have other outside earnings.][[0]]
[The Commons inquiry was launched in the wake of controversy over Student Loans Company boss Ed Lester’s employment through a personal service company without tax being deducted.][[0]]
[Following a review, the Treasury disclosed in May that more than 2,400 Whitehall staff, each earning more than £58,200 a year, were being paid directly and without PAYE deductions.][[0]]
[But the public accounts committee warned that the Treasury’s review of off-payroll arrangements had been ‘limited’ because it did not cover the wider public sector like local government, the NHS or the BBC.][[0]]
[Mrs Hodge said the committee suspected ‘many individuals and employers in local government and in the health service do not pay their proper tax and national insurance contributions’.][[0]]
[In a statement last night the BBC said: ‘We note the conclusions of the PAC report and will respond to the points raised as part of our detailed review of tax arrangements.’ A spokesman added: ‘The BBC pointed out that this relates to 25,000 contracts and not 25,000 people, and that in many cases an individual – such as an occasional contributor to programmes – could be issued with a contract each time he or she is booked to appear.’][[0]]
[Mr Paxman has said it was not his choice to be paid through a private service company.][[0]]
[The Newsnight presenter insisted the BBC had ‘required me to form a company if I wanted to continue to present Newsnight. It claimed it had been told to do so by the HMRC’.][[0]]
[Antiques Roadshow presenter Miss Bruce said she had formed a company because ‘it was a stipulation laid down by the BBC’.][[0]]
[Last year tax inspectors launched just 23 investigations into breaches of the law surrounding personal service companies – down from more than 1,000 a year a decade ago.][[0]]

[Disgraced running back Adrian Peterson has been credited with the Minnesota Vikings' impressive win at the weekend - despite not even being on the field.][[0]]
[The NFL player, who is currently waiting action on child abuse charges  in Texas, sent a text message to coach Mike Zimmer before Sunday's game.][[1]]
[According to his former teammates, it was Peterson's motivational words  that fired them up to secure an incredible 41-28 win over the Atlanta Falcons.][[1]]
[According to 1500ESPN, Starting quarterback Teddy Bridgewater described the message as 'very deep'.][[1]]
['One thing that I took away from that message was: 'play each down like it's your last because you never know when it's going to be your last opportunity,' he said.][[0]]
['Today I think the guys got that message pretty well. We went out, we fought today and it was just a great overall team effort.'][[0]]
[Vikings running back Matt Asiata did not specify exactly what Peterson wrote, but he did describe the text message as a 'motivational speech'.][[0]]
['We felt him in spirit,' Asiata said. 'He gave us a text, a motivational speech in a text, and we came out punching.'][[0]]
[The motivation certainly appeared to have worked on Asiata, who scored three touchdowns. The Vikings finished with a season-high 241 rushing yards off Asiata's 78.][[0]]
[Peterson   has been away from the team since September 17, when the Vikings reversed their initial decision to reinstate him following a 60-hour ban. The Vikings could play the rest of 2014 without him.][[0]]
[On September 12, Peterson was indicted in Montgomery County, Texas, for felony injury to a child.][[0]]
[During interviews with Child Protective Services and Texas law enforcement, Peterson admitted to giving his son two spankings, one with a belt and the other with a switch, as 'physical discipline,' according to the complaint.][[1]]
[Since details of the allegations have emerged, Peterson has been dropped from the Vikings' active roster while the criminal case against him is pending in Texas, where he has an October 8 arraignment.][[0]]

[The Vikings placed Peterson on the 'exempt/commissioner's permission' list, taking him off the roster and bowing to pressure from outraged fans and sponsors.][[0]]
[The fallout from the abuse allegations have led to major sponsors dropping the NFL star from lucrative endorsement deals.][[0]]
[Linebacker Gerald Hodges said the text message sent to Zimmer who read it out to the team ahead of the game at the TCF Bank Stadium in Minnesota.][[0]]
['[Peterson] just sent it to coach,' Hodges said. 'Him and coach were texting back and [Peterson] said he wanted to share some things.][[0]]
['He just said he'd love to be out here, would be dying to be out here with us. But everything's out of his control. He just said go out there and play your hearts out like it's your last time playing.'][[0]]

[An urn said to contain the remnants of Buddha has been stolen from its shrine in Udong, Cambodia, pictured above][[0]]
[A golden urn believed to contain the remnant of Budda's body has been stolen from its shrine in Cambodia.][[1]]
[Officials in the south east Asian country said the relics, which have enormous religion and cultural significance for Cambodians, were taken from the mountain shrine close to the capital Phnom Penh.][[0]]
[A government spokesman called for those responsible to be brought to justice.][[1]]
[He said: 'This relic has been respected by][[0]]
[Buddhist followers for thousands of years.][[0]]
['This theft cannot be accepted. The perpetrator and any associates who][[0]]
[connived to commit such a crime must be prosecuted according to the law][[0]]
[Police said a guard was woken by a barking dog on Tuesday.][[1]]
[It was then the guard discovered the lock to the shrine's door had been damaged and the urn had disappeared.][[1]]
[Officers quizzed 13 of the shrine's guards and detained six as suspects, but said the authorities had no information about the relics' location.][[0]]
[The relics were moved by the late King Norodom Sihanouk in 2002 from Phnom Penh to the mountain shrine in the former royal city of Udong in a ceremony attended by tens of thousands of people.][[1]]
[Several countries in Asia][[0]]
[possess relics believed to come from the body of Buddha.][[0]]
[The relics were moved by the late King Norodom Sihanouk in 2002, from Phnom Penh, pictured, to the mountain shrine in the former royal city of Udong][[0]]
[The urn was housed inside one of four stupas - a mound-like or semi-hemispherical structure containing Buddhist relics - in the city of Udong, the former capital of Cambodia.][[0]]
[Perched in the hills around 22 miles from Phnom Penh, the city was the home of the royal family between 1618 and 1866.][[0]]
[At the northwestern corner of the hill four stupas can be seen piercing the skyline.][[0]]
[The first is the tomb of King Monivong (r.1927 to 1941). The second is said to be the tomb of King Ang Duog (r. 1845-59) and the third is the tomb of King Sorivopor (r. prior to 1618).][[0]]
[The fourth stupa is where the urn, which is said to contain Buddha's remains, was stored.][[0]]
[A statue of Buddha at Vihear Preah Kep, on the hill of the royal treasury in Udong in Cambodia][[0]]
[Siddhartha Gautama Buddha, known simply as Buddha, was a sage or wise person, on whose teachings the religion of Buddhism was founded.][[0]]
[Buddha means the 'awakened one' or the 'enlightened one'.][[0]]
[Buddhism is the story of one man's spiritual journey to enlightenment, and the teachings that derived from it.][[0]]
[Historians have estimated Siddhartha Gautama lived between 490 BCE and circa 410 BCE.][[0]]
[He was born into a royal family in a Nepalese village in the foothills of the Himalayas.][[0]]
[It is said that having lived in a royal palace, Siddhartha Gautama, had been sheltered from seeing those struck down by illness and poverty.][[0]]
[Having married and fathered a child he ventured from the royal enclosure where he is said to have laid eyes on a sick man, an old man and a corpse, for the first time.][[0]]
[He learned age, sickness and death are inevitable for everyone.][[0]]
[On his trip he came across a monk and saw the encounter as a sign he should leave his fortunate life and live as a homeless holy man.][[0]]
[Depriving himself of life's luxuries and living in a state of extreme abstinence for six years did not provide him with an answer to escaping suffering in the world.][[0]]
[Instead Siddhartha Gautama found a middle way living his life between poverty and luxury.][[0]]
[It is said that when he was sitting underneath a Bodhi tree, Siddhartha became deeply immersed in meditation, reflecting on life.][[0]]
[It was then that he achieved enlightenment and became Buddha.][[0]]
[The site at which Buddha achieved enlightenment, the Mahabodhi Temple, is now a pilgrimage site.][[0]]
[Buddha spent his life teaching and the religion to this day focuses on the importance of teaching.][[0]]

[Hospital car parks have raked in more than £1billion from patients, relatives and staff in the last ten years, figures revealed yesterday.][[0]]
[Drivers are now stumping up £160million a year in charges – more than double the amount of a decade ago.][[0]]
[One in four hospital trusts raise at least £1million a year in fees, with some pocketing nearly £4million. Critics describe the charges as a ‘tax on the sick’ and have called for them to be abolished.][[0]]
[Worst offender: The Heart of England Hospital Trust in Birmingham brings in the most in parking charges a year in the UK][[1]]
[England is the only country in the UK where hospitals still charge for parking – Scotland and Wales outlawed the practice in 2009.][[0]]
[Figures obtained by Tory MP Chris Skidmore show that an average hospital trust now collects £1.055million a year from parking, more than twice as much as in 2001/2 when it was just over £400,000.][[0]]
[Top of the list is the Heart of England NHS Trust in Birmingham, which last year raked in £3.9million.][[0]]
[Leeds Teaching Hospitals collected £3.4million, closely followed by Nottingham University Hospitals on just over £3million.][[0]]
[Worry: Tory MP Chris Skidmore said the NHS needs to look at time spent in hospital less stressful by slashing charges][[0]]
[Mr Skidmore, who is a member of the][[0]]
[Commons Health Select Committee said: ‘Attending a hospital can be a][[0]]
[difficult and stressful experience without having to worry about being][[0]]
[heavily charged for parking or fined. Many patients will need repeated][[0]]
[treatment and require frequent visits to hospitals.][[0]]
[‘Many trusts have found effective][[0]]
[local solutions to ensuring patients and their families are not][[0]]
[penalised, but it is clear that the NHS as a whole should look at what][[0]]
[works in the best trusts in order to ensure that hospital visits are as][[0]]

[disgraceful tax on the sick and their visitors. They target the most][[0]]
[vulnerable and those who are often already under increased financial][[0]]
[pressure that illness can bring.][[0]]
[huge increase in money generated by the charges suggest hospitals are][[0]]
[using them more and more as a revenue-raiser rather than just paying for][[0]]
[Murphy, chief executive of the Patients’ Association, added: ‘Parking][[0]]
[charges hit patients hard – particularly the elderly or those who are][[0]]
[vulnerable and unable to use public transport.][[0]]
[affected will be those with chronic conditions who go to hospital][[0]]
[regularly. It’s the last thing patients, relatives and carers need.’][[0]]
[Mr Skidmore obtained figures from two-thirds of hospital trusts.][[0]]
[on the average charges, hospitals in England last year collected more][[0]]
[than £160million compared to £63million ten years ago.][[0]]
[And in the last decade they have pocketed just over £1billion, the figures show.][[0]]

[Separate figures from the Department of Health show that 45 trusts – more than a quarter – have increased their fees.][[0]]
[At Wirral University Teaching Hospital NHS Trust, they went up from 83p an hour to £2.50.][[0]]
[The most expensive rate is found at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London, which charges £3.50 an hour. But some trusts have broken ranks and scrapped the charges in spite of the loss of income.][[0]]
[In 2010, Trafford Hospital in Manchester announced parking would be free as fees were an ‘unnecessary stress, expense and hassle.’][[0]]

[A nine-year-old girl has reportedly been flown out of Australia to be married in the Middle East.][[0]]
[The Immigrant Women’s Health Service, based in western Sydney, claims it learned about the case on Sunday but has no more details.][[1]]
[It spoke to the girl's mother after receiving a tip-off, the ABC reports.][[1]]
[A 9-year-old girl from Sydney has left Australia to be made into a child bride, it's claimed (stock photo shown)][[0]]
[Dr Eman Sharobeem, director of the Immigrant Women's Health Service, warned that the government is not doing enough to prevent young girls from being married off illegally.][[0]]
[She said its strategy to stop child brides would fail because the girls don’t want to implicate their families in the crime.][[0]]
[She reasoned: ‘I don't hope and wish to see parents behind bars ... I already tried with many of them to talk about informing the authorities, and as soon as I put that on the table the girls actually turn their back and say “we're not even going to have a conversation with you”.’][[0]]
[Dr  Sharobeem was forced to be a child bride while she was 14 and living in Egypt.][[0]]
['It's not secret within our communities. It’s maybe secret to the eyes of the rest of the Australian community,' she told 60 Minutes earlier this year.][[0]]
[Federal Justice Minister Michael Keenan told the ABC: ‘We're very keen to ... make sure that if somebody is to come across this type of crime that they know how to go about helping that person to report it to authorities so we can do something about it.’][[0]]
[Minister for Women Pru Goward said parents needed to know it was illegal to take their child overseas for a forced marriage.][[0]]
['Certainly the person who "married" the girl can be prosecuted and it is just an unacceptable part of life in Australia,' she told Macquarie Radio on Tuesday.][[0]]
[In October, in an unrelated case, a 27-year-old Lebanese student, who can't be named, pleaded guilty in Burwood Local Court on Thursday to one count of persistent sexual abuse of a child, which carries a 25-year maximum jail sentence][[0]]
[The latest case comes as the federal government launches an awareness campaign to encourage young women to report child marriages.][[0]]
['We're making sure that we have materials out there to educate the community about what to look for and so these crimes can be reported and then the appropriate authorities can go and prosecute them,' Mr Keenan said.][[0]]
[But Dr Sharobeem, said brochures would have little effect.][[0]]
['Forced marriage and child brides happen among the culturally and linguistically diverse communities, those communities will not go to the website and will not share glossy papers to see what's written about legislation in the country,' she said.][[0]]
[There are currently 70 million child brides in the world. The National Children’s and Youth Law Centre has identified approximately 250 child marriages in Australia over the last two years but many more cases are thought to have gone unreported.][[1]]
[In countries like Yemen, Bangladesh and Nigeria, marrying daughters off has been done for generations but in Australia the practice is often used to control children's behaviour, for family businesses, or to meet perceived community expectations.][[0]]
[Australia has laws in place to protect children:][[0]]
[In October, a man accused of 'marrying' and having a sexual relationship with a 12-year-old girl, pleaded guilty to ongoing child sex abuse.][[0]]

['Small businesses are the lifeblood of our country - essential for building a resilient, sustainable economy and a central part of my long-term economic plan for Britain,' Mr Cameron said.][[0]]
['They account for 99 in every 100 businesses and keep more than 11 million people in work so this isn't about sentimentality, it's about the future of Britain, creating jobs and turning our economy around.][[0]]

['In particular we are tackling the issue of late payment, which can threaten the survival of otherwise healthy businesses. We are enforcing prompt payment through the entire public sector and asking what more we can do to get credit flowing in the private sector.'][[0]]
[Enterprise and skills minister Matthew Hancock said: 'Small businesses are the lifeblood of the British economy and responsible for nearly half the job creation in the UK.

[Dr Adam Marshall, director of policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: 'The Government is right to say that Britain is a great place to start a business. Now it needs to become a great place to grow a business too. That means ensuring that fast-growing and dynamic small companies get access to the capital they need to expand, and access to practical business-to-business support to break into new markets around the world.'][[0]]
[Terry Scuoler, chief executive of the manufacturers organisation the EEF, said: 'Small businesses are a vital part of the economy and we need to make it easier for them to invest, grow and create the highly skilled innovative jobs our economy needs.][[0]]
['The more we can grow into larger medium size companies, the better for UK plc. In order to enable this we need to examine every means to removing some of the barriers they face, improving the business environment and making it easier for them to fulfil their potential.'][[0]]

[They are known as some of nature's most reclusive predators, and it seems this owl was keen to live up to that reputation when it was spotted by a photographer in a park in the Czech Republic.][[1]]
[Peeking out from behind a tree, the huge bird of prey appeared to play hide and seek with senior engineer and photographer Jiri Michal as he tried to capture it on film.][[0]]

[Playing games: Mr Michal, who spent three hours trying to photograph owls before spotting this one, said he wasn't sure what the bird was doing, but it appeared to be playing a game with him][[0]]
[Mr Michal, 34, of Pilsen, Czech Republic, said: 'I wasn't sure what this mischievous owl was doing, however it kept poking its head out from behind this tree as if it was playing a game with me.][[1]]
['Owls are definitely my favourite birds. They have amazing eyes and are always pleasure to photograph.'][[0]]
[Mr Michal said he had been photographing the birds for three hours when he spotted this one roughly 20ft away.][[0]]
[He added: 'This owl was not in the mood to play for too long, and straight after I took these pictures he flew off.][[0]]
['I'm forever thinking up new ideas for what to photograph and I love nature as a whole. From the smallest insects to the larger birds and mammals, they must all be protected.'][[0]]
[The great grey owl is the largest species of owl, measuring up to two and a half feet in length, and lives in northern America, Canada, and northern Europe.][[0]]

[Now you see me: The great grey owl is the largest species of owl, measuring up to two and a half feet in length. Despite the animal's reputation for being nocturnal, this species often hunts during the day][[1]]
[Youngster: Mr Michal believes the owl was a male, and was around seven years old, making it relatively young. Captive birds have been known to live up to 27 years old][[0]]
[Their large face, and two disc-shaped plumes of feathers around their eyes, act as satellite dishes, filtering sound into two highly sensitive ears under the feathers.][[0]]
[Their hearing is so acute that, during the winter months, the owls often hunt by swooping low over snow drifts, listening for the sound of voles or gophers moving around underneath.][[0]]
[Their large, soft feathers and slow, deep wingbeats mean they are nearly silent as they move, so as not to scare their prey away.][[0]]
[Once they have locked on to a target underneath the snow, they will use their sharp talons to plunge through the ice and drag their meal out.][[0]]
[While the birds are not migratory, they will roam for miles around their usual hunting grounds if prey becomes scarce.][[0]]

[The Match of the Day presenter has discovered his great, great, great grandfather, James Pratt, was jailed in the 1800s for poaching birds to feed his eight children.][[1]]
[James served his time in jail in Leicester which included six months for stealing chickens.][[1]]
[The football legend made the discovery while filming BBC1's Who Do You Think You Are?][[1]]
[According to The Sunday People, the father-of-four said 'Most of us would do anything for our children to keep them well, to keep them fed. He had no choice. He must have been desperate. You can understand that.'][[0]]
[Lineker, who played for Leicester City, Everton, Barcelona and Spurs, returned to his old stomping ground of Leicester in January to film scenes for the history show.][[0]]
[He joins a long list of celebrities who have taken part in the programme which traces their family trees to discover surprises from their past.][[0]]

[Ronny Deila branded Craig Gordon ‘fantastic’ after the Celtic keeper produced a top-drawer display to earn his side a Europa League point in Salzburg.][[1]]
[The Scottish champions twice took the lead in the Red Bull Arena with goals in each half from debutant Wakaso Mubarak and a deflected Scott Brown effort. It took a blistering free-kick from Salzburg’s skipper Jonathan Soriano 12 minutes from time to salvage a 2-2 draw after Brazilian Alan had cancelled out Mubarak’s opener with a wicked deflection off Efe Ambrose.][[0]]
[But the hosts would surely have had all three points but for a sublime Gordon fingertip stop in the first half and a stunning double save in the second.][[0]]
[Craig Gordon produces a stunning save to stop Alan getting his second goal for Salzburg][[0]]
[‘Craig’s performance was just marvellous,’ said Deila, with the Scotland international fast consigning £10million predecessor Fraser Forster to history. ‘I think he has been good all season but he’s progressing all the time and getting better and better.][[0]]
[‘He is a top professional and a fantastic man, a good boy. I am so glad to have him in the group.][[1]]
[‘Before I came to Celtic I had only seen him on TV when he played for Sunderland so I didn’t know all about him.][[0]]
[‘But (goalkeeping coach) Stevie Woods told me he was ready and he is showing he’s such a fantastic goalkeeper. He is back at the level he was at before with Stevie training him so well. He’s done such a fantastic job, too.][[0]]
[‘Together they have got back again – and they will keep on going. Craig has just been a fantastic signing for us. We had a fantastic goalkeeper in Fraser Forster but now we have another one – and a fantastic goalkeeping coach.’][[0]]
[Celtic's Craig Gordon pulls off yet another brilliant save in a performance his manager called marvellous][[0]]
[Despite being beaten twice Cetlic keeper Craig Gordon showed he is back to his best this season][[0]]
[Gordon’s form has been stunning and he is proving the doubters wrong after returning from two years on the sidelines with a knee injury.][[0]]
[Salzburg coach Adi Sutter echoed his opposite number, saying of Gordon’s display: ‘He was fantastic and saved a point for Celtic.’][[0]]
[Celtic were accused of penny pinching after replacing Forster with a free transfer, but Deila believes the former Hearts man is making his point on the pitch.][[0]]
[‘I think so. He is very professional and he knows his body very well. He will work all the time but you never know in football - things can happen tomorrow, but so far he has been fantastic and if we keep him fit he will continue to be that.][[0]]
[Craig Gordon salutes the Celtic fans after a superb performance helped his side earn a point in Salzburg][[1]]
[‘I think we have improved in the back four. We have to work on the right side because we had some trouble in the second half, but it was a good performance and the central defenders are working well together.][[0]]
[‘Jason Denayer has been a very good signing and Virgil (van Dijk) is improving with every match he plays at a high level. That gives me a good feeling.’][[0]]
[Deila was also delighted with Mubarak’s debut goal and performance and sees signs of improvement in his team after a dismal double exit from the Champions League to Legia Warsaw and Maribor.][[0]]
[‘I love to work in football to create things and I think now we are progressing. We see there is a lot of work to do to get even better.][[0]]
[Ronny Deila praised his goalkeeper Craig Gordon and was pleased with the progress his team are making][[0]]
[‘I want to control the matches more than we do by controlling the ball, but that will take time. We need more fitness and quickness on the ball and that’s what we are going to work on this year so that hopefully we will be more ready for the Champions League.’][[0]]
[Meanwhile, Scott Brown will today make his own way back from Austria - after Celtic were forced to leave their captain behind in Salzburg.][[0]]
[The closure of the local airport at 11pm local time prompted a Celtic dash for their flight minutes after the 2-2 draw, but goalscorer Brown had been called in for a UEFA drugs test and was unable to produce a urine sample quickly.][[0]]
[Aleksandar Tonev was also tested and made the plane in time but Brown was less fortunate and will fly home alone ahead of Sunday’s game with Motherwell.][[0]]

[Terrified Becky Miller, 21, was tied][[0]]
[to a chair, and was slashed, burned with a cigarette lighter and kicked][[1]]
[in the ordeal in Birkenhead, Merseyside, which has left her scarred for life.][[0]]

[cousins Ashleigh Gray, 20, and Kelly Harrison, 30, and Marie Frank, 22,][[0]]
[showed no remorse when they appeared in the dock.][[0]]
[They have been jailed for a total of seven years for actual bodily harm and false imprisonment.][[1]]
[The attack in February last year has left Miss Miller afraid to go out and needing psychiatric counselling.][[1]]
[The court heard that trouble flared on a 'night in for][[0]]
[the girls' which descended into a fight after several hours or snorting cocaine and drinking vodka and brandy.][[1]]
[After the attack Miss Miller only managed to escape after a row broke out between the gang and she fled, cowering behind a car.][[0]]
[Former shop-owner Harrison had invited Keating and Gray to her £175,000 flat in East Float Dock in Birkenhead where, with Frank, they spent the evening drinking and taking drugs with Harrison's four-year-old daughter Precious was asleep in another bedroom.][[0]]
[Miller arrived at the flat when Harrison and Gray picked her up from Liverpool when they were returning from picking-up more cocaine for the second time that night.][[0]]
[Jurors heard how Harrison's sister,][[0]]

[Prosecution counsel Mr Neville Biddle QC said: 'Miss Miller was begging to call a taxi and to be allowed to go home.][[0]]
['But she was punched in the nose by Ashleigh Gray who made her clean the floor of her own blood before Jocelyn Keating dragged her around the floor. Kelly Harrison then slapped her and she heard someone say 'cut her fingers off'.][[0]]
['There was an attempt to tie her up and she was told she would never see her baby again and one of the 'fellas' was coming round to pour acid on her face.][[1]]
['Keating then took pictures and posted them on Facebook before she and Gray burned the jacket and her hair. Miss Miller told police 'they just kept burning me and burning me'.'][[0]]
[As the attack continued Miss Harrison and Miss Frank laughed as threats were made on their victim's life, as she screamed and begged them to let her go.][[0]]
[Frank was reported to have said: 'If I kill you I would get away with it because I'm a schizophrenic.'][[0]]
[Miss Miller managed to escape at 7:30am when an argument erupted between her tormentors, she fled the flat and cowered behind a car where she used a mobile phone dial to 999 but before police arrived another resident came to her aid.][[0]]
[Miss Miller was too scared to go near to the flat but when officers arrived they arrested the four women, despite their attempts to clear-up incriminating evidence.][[0]]
[Crime scene: The four-hour ordeal took place at Kelly Harrison's flat in East Float Quay in Birkenhead][[0]]
[In the 16 months since the attack she has been too frightened to go out socially and is scheduled for psychiatric counselling.][[0]]
[Each of the defence counsels told Judge Graham Morrow QC that the four felt 'remorse' for what took place and pleaded for leniency, saying they had troubled pasts.][[0]]
[At their trial Miss Harrison and Miss Frank were convicted on charges of causing actual bodily harm and false imprisonment. Miss Keating, Miss Gray, pleaded guilty to similar charges.][[0]]
[Sentencing them Judge Morrow QC said: 'Keating and Gray did most of the attacking and Frank did the least but Harrison it was your flat and your daughter was there.][[0]]
['Each of you embarked on a campaign of mindless and atrocious violence which forced your victim to genuinely fear for her life. I can sum-up your crime simply - you tortured her.][[0]]
['While you witnessed Miss Miller giving evidence I saw that you showed no emotion. There is only one sentence to impose and that is a custodial one.'][[0]]
[Keating, who pleaded guilty, was jailed for 22 months, while Gray was sentenced to 21 months detention in a Young Offenders Institute.][[0]]
[Harrison was jailed for 27 months and Frank was sent down for 20 months.][[0]]

[The X2 uses two propellers strapped to the outside of the user's wrist.][[0]]
[It is powered by a lithium battery and controlled wirelessly.][[0]]
[The inventors say it is superior to other underwater propulsion systems because the thrust doesn't go straight into the users body.][[0]]

[Pro-choice activists hold signs marching with the support of Pope Francis, who showed his support via Twitter][[0]]
[Roe V Wade was the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalised abortion within the first two months of pregnancy. Before it, state laws regulated abortions, forcing women to take dangerous, often illegal measures to get an abortion.][[1]]
[In Texas in 1969, Norma McCorvey (later given the alias Jane Roe) was single and pregnant, and wanted to have an abortion. But under state laws, she was unable to have abortions except in the cases of incest or rape, so she claimed she was raped to get an abortion. This was thrown out.][[0]]
[McCorvey sued for the right to an abortion. After a legal battle, the district court ruled that Texas laws infringed on Ninth and Fourteenth amendments of the constitution (right to privacy and citizens’ rights).][[0]]
[Eventually her case landed in the supreme court, where they ruled that ‘the right to privacy is broad enough to encompass a woman’s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy’.][[0]]
[The event has attracted serious media attention each year since it began, bringing with it big-name speakers, such as former president George W. Bush.][[0]]
[This year, the theme of the march was 'Adoption: A Noble Decision', espousing the benefits of giving a child up for adoption as an alternative to abortion.][[0]]
[Protesters came from Georgia, Missouri and Pennsylvania, with youngsters coming from schools and colleges in Chigaco and Cleveland, among others.][[0]]

[The Environmental Protection Agency's top climate change expert and highest paid employee was sentenced to 32 months in federal prison today for defrauding the government.][[0]]
[John C. Beale, who lives with his wife in Virginia, claimed he was a CIA agent working in Pakistan so he didn't have to show up for work for months at a time and defrauded the government out of more than $900,000. He said he did it out of 'greed' and got a 'rush of excitement' from it.][[1]]
[The 65-year-old's 13 year scam was 'inexplicable' and 'unbelievably egregious', Judge Ellen Huvelle said in Washington D.C. federal court today.][[0]]

[climate change expert, who reported directly to EPA Administrator Gina][[0]]
[McCarthy, said he was ashamed of his CIA scam, which he ran from 2000][[0]]
[until earlier this year, according to court documents.][[0]]
[Beale told the court today: 'Why did I do this? Greed - simple greed - and I'm ashamed of that greed.'][[1]]

[he escaped to his vacation home on Cape Cod, prosecutors said.][[0]]
[billed taxpayers for 33 plane flights between 2003 and 2011, including][[0]]
[personal trips to London and California, which he flew first class. He][[0]]

[and limo rides. The total cost: more than $266,000.][[0]]

[EPA Assistant Inspector General Patrick Sullivan told NBC that Beale perpetrated a 'crime of massive proportions.'][[0]]
[He has been labeled a 'poster child for what is wrong with the government.'][[0]]
[His sentence got a quick reaction from Capitol Hill and a top republican has demanded further investigation into the EPA to find out how Beale got away with his scam for so long.][[0]]
['This case this morning highlights a massive problem with the EPA', Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana told NBC.][[0]]
[Beale's direct boss, Gina McCarthy, was criticized for not noticing the scam going on right under her nose, but Sen. Barbara Boxer of California, who is chair of the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee, defended McCarthy.][[0]]
['I commend the EPA administrator (McCarthy) for taking steps to shine a light on the actions of this rogue employee, and her actions helped uncover these crimes', she said.][[0]]
[Sullivan, who investigated Beale, said he believes the culture of the EPA made it ripe for this sort of fraud.][[0]]
[Beale seen in court on December 16 as the trial for his fraud case was ongoing][[0]]
['There’s a certain culture here at the EPA where the mission is the most important thing,' he told NBC.][[0]]
['They don’t think like criminal investigators. They tend to be very trusting and accepting.'][[0]]
[Beale's lawyer had asked for leniency after a psychological review showed he had a 'highly self-destructive and dysfunctional need to engage in excessively reckless, risky behavior.'][[0]]

[David Moyes has been counted out of one of the plum jobs waiting to be filled at the end of the season.][[0]]
[Bayer Leverkusen would have been the perfect fit for relaunching the 50-year old Scot’s managerial career after the shock of being sacked just 10 months into his Old Trafford tenure.][[0]]
[They are on the look out for a new boss after firing former Liverpool defender Sami Hyypia earlier this month and are on course for a Champions League place. Additionally, Moyes spoke of his wish to manage a top German side in a recent interview.][[1]]
[But Sportsmail understands Leverkusen’s board have ruled him out on grounds of price and profile.][[1]]
[Ruled out: David Moyes is too expensive to be considered for the Bayer Leverkusen job][[0]]
[They want a younger coach in the mould of Borussia Dortmund’s Jurgen Klopp and are unwilling to pay any more than £1.2million a year for the right man. The initial response from the Bay Arena is that Moyes – like former Chelsea boss Roberto Di Matteo, who also briefly came under consideration – would be too expensive after earning £5m a year at United.][[0]]
[They are also unconvinced that Moyes, who turns 51 on Friday, fits into the category of coach they are looking for after making a policy decision to try and unearth the next Klopp and setting their sights on three targets.][[0]]
[One of the trio, 40-year old Thomas Tuchel, has already ruled himself out after declaring he intends spending at least one more season at Mainz, where he took over in August, 2009 and reeled off seven straight wins at the start of the 2010-11 season, including a victory at Bayern Munich.][[0]]
[But Red Bull Salzburg’s Roger Schmidt and Augsburg’s 39-year old coach Markus Weinzierl are still in the frame and look to be locked in a straight fight to succeed Hyypia.][[1]]

[Down and out: Hyypia was sacked but Leverkusen are on course for a Champions League spot][[0]]
[Click here to see David Moyes' job options][[0]]
[Weinzierl’s stock has been steadily rising and reached new heights recently when his unfancied team beat Bayern to end the European champions’ remarkable 53-game unbeaten run, while Schmidt has suffered only six defeats in 47 games as Salzburg boss and has just steered them to the Austrian title by finishing an incredible 24 points ahead of Rapid Vienna.][[0]]
[News that Leverkusen are currently looking no further than those two may well come as a disappointment to Moyes, who admitted in an interview with France Football just 16 months ago: ‘I always had the hope of being a coach abroad,’ he said.][[0]]
[Straight fight: Roger Schmidt (left) and Markus Weinzierl are in the frame to replace Hyypia at Leverkusen][[0]]
[‘If I had the choice, I would probably go to Germany, in part because they have a mentality there that is similar to mine but also because I am fascinated by what happens in German football. They seem to have found a way of producing young players.’][[0]]
[Unfortunately for Moyes, they also seem to have found a way of producing young coaches, and Leverkusen are closing in on two of the brightest, rather than venturing further afield, for their next managerial appointment.][[0]]

[TechNiche has launched a selection of clothes that can heat up to a toasty 60°C.][[1]]
[Cosy: A new range of heated clothing - such as the vest, pictured - could be the answer to winter shivers][[0]]
[The IonGear battery-powered vests, jackets and gloves use lithium batteries and carbon filaments to generate heat and are adjustable so a wearer can choose the temperature according to the weather.][[1]]
[Its makers say the clothing is aimed at those who work outdoors, exercise outside, compete as an athlete in extreme weather or just feel the cold very easily.][[1]]
[After stepping back indoors, a user simply recharges the battery and the garment is ready to use again the next day.][[1]]

[Scandal: Ex leader of the Paedophile Information Exchange, Tom O'Carroll, was jailed for child sex offences, and claimed today that 'Harman and co' made no effort to remove him or other members][[0]]
[Fresh questions emerged today about how influential a despised paedophile group were in the civil liberties organisation that Harriet Harman helped run before she became an MP.][[0]]
[The former leader of the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) said the Labour Deputy Leader and the National Council of Civil Liberties (NCCL) made 'no attempts' to 'kick out' his group.][[0]]
[Tom O'Carroll, who has been convicted of a number of child sex offences and was described as 'one of the most infamous perverts on Earth', sat on the NCCL's  gay rights sub-committee in the late 1970s.][[1]]
[In the eight years PIE was given affiliate status, O'Carroll said he spoke at the NCCL's 1977 Spring conference, two years after he helped lead a campaign to cut the age of consent to as low as ten.][[0]]
[Today he told the BBC that Ms Harman and][[1]]
[Patricia Hewitt, then general secretary of the NCCL, and later a Labour health secretary, 'didn't even try' to remove him or other members because they 'didn't want to rock the boat' to protect their own careers.][[1]]
['Really they didn't do much to oppose PIE's presence in my view because][[0]]
[there were these other liberal forces, or radical forces, within NCCL,' he told the Today Programme.][[0]]
[support didn't come from Harman and co but it was there. The gay][[0]]
[liberation front was very radical and at that time Harman and Patricia][[0]]
[Hewitt couldn't just kick out PIE, well they could both try but they][[0]]
[didn't even try and the reason they didn't try is they didn't want to][[1]]
[rock the boat because their careers within NCCL depended on them not][[1]]
[rocking the boat too much.'][[0]]
[Questions remain: Labour Deputy Leader Harriet Harman arrives in Oxford today for a media convention][[0]]
[Scandal: After six days of questions over her links to a paedophile group, Labour's Harriet Harman has finally expressed regret but not a full apology][[1]]
[He told the programme he never met Ms Harman or her husband Jack Dromey, who was on the NCCL's executive, but he met Ms Hewitt briefly at a conference in Sheffield in 1978.][[1]]
[He said: 'I spoke to her when we were just going up a floor or two in a lift and she was somewhat frosty.][[0]]
[said something to her, I think as a pleasantry, and she didn't take it][[0]]
[that way. She said that I'd been rude to her afterwards, which I hadn't][[0]]
['My impression was that she simply had great distaste for being in the same lift as me.'][[0]]
[His comments were rubbished today by people including, Jack Dromey, who said the convicted paedophile has no credibility.][[0]]
[Mr Dromey said in a statement: 'Quite simply, no one will believe a man like Tom O'Carroll.'][[0]]

[included Andrew Sadler, a prep school teacher and PIE organiser jailed][[0]]
[in Romania for sexual corruption and sex with a minor; Steven Smith, a former][[0]]
[chairman, who was jailed for possessing indecent images; and Morris][[0]]
[Harriet Harman belatedly expressed ‘regret’ yesterday that the vile paedophile group was allowed to forge links with the National Council for Civil Liberties.][[0]]
[But she still refused to apologise over the NCCL’s extraordinary relationship with the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange.][[0]]
[Labour’s deputy leader has repeatedly resisted calls to comment on the Mail’s revelations that she, her MP husband Jack Dromey and former health secretary Patricia Hewitt held key roles in the pressure group that granted ‘affiliate’ status to PIE, a group of predatory paedophiles who openly campaigned to legalise child sex.][[0]]
[On Monday evening, Miss Harman dismissed the revelations as a ‘politically-motivated smear campaign’. But hours after a disastrous BBC Newsnight appearance she abruptly changed tack.][[0]]
[Faced with questions over why she found it so difficult in the interview to condemn the link with PIE – who wanted the age of consent to be four – Miss Harman issued a statement yesterday through her spokesman, who said: ‘She regrets the existence of PIE and she regrets their involvement with NCCL before she joined, although it was immaterial to her work.’][[0]]
[Document: This is the cover page of the NCCL's submission to Parliament on the 1976 Sexual Offences Act held at the LSE library, which suggests that the age of consent be lowered to 14][[0]]
[Damning: On page six of the document it is argued that 'a person aged 14 or over should be legally capable of giving consent' and the age of sexual consent cut to ten 'if the child understood the nature of the act'][[0]]
[Former culture secretary Tessa Jowell has said Ms Harman had been a][[0]]
[lifelong feminist and 'wasn't chasing wacky causes' during the 1970s.][[0]]
[told Today: 'Harriet, Jack Dromey, were completely consistent in their][[0]]
[opposition to the vile influence of the Paedophile Information][[0]]
[Ms Jowell said there was 'not one shred of evidence that they gave any comfort to this revolting organisation'.][[0]]
[added: 'There's no question of post-hoc justification here. The][[0]]
[evidence shows how vigorous Jack Dromey was in his attack on the][[0]]
[Paedophile Information Exchange.][[0]]
['Harriet's work at NCCL didn't bring her into contact with them at all.'][[0]]
[1978 briefing: The NCCL legal officer Harriet Harman wrote this briefing paper on the Protection of Children Bill, which sought to ban child pornography. She argued that it would lead to an 'increase in censorship'][[0]]

[Recommendations: Miss Harman's briefing went on that the NCCL would argue that the Bill to protect children should be amended][[0]]
[Signed: The Labour Deputy Leader's name is carried at the bottom of a briefing that argued that a pornographic picture of a naked child should not be considered indecent unless it could be proven that the subject had suffered][[0]]
[Jack Dromey has spoken out for the first time and said he is 'proud' of his support for a controversial civil liberties organisation in the 1970s.][[0]]
[He also said that he led the fight to stop paedophiles having any influence in it.][[0]]
[Mr Dromey said he chose to stay within the civil liberties organisation and led the fight against paedophile attempts to infiltrate it.][[0]]
[He said: 'I took them on and defeated them. They published a leaflet denouncing me.'][[0]]
[Asked why he didn't simply resign from the NCCL when the Paedophile Information Exchange became involved, he said he believed it was important to stay and fight them.][[0]]
['I stayed and took them on.][[0]]
['I'm proud of the stand that I took. They are loathsome. And I'm proud of the stand that I took taking them on.][[0]]

[now the respected Liberty – filed a submission to Parliament claiming][[0]]
[that ‘childhood sexual experiences, willingly engaged in, with an adult,][[0]]
[result in no identifiable damage’.][[0]]
[NCCL lawyers also acted for PIE members who were questioned by police over their disgusting behaviour.][[0]]
[Ms Hewitt was general  secretary of][[0]]
[the NCCL from 1974-83. Miss Harman was a newly qualified solicitor when][[0]]
[she became its legal officer in 1978 until 1982, when she entered][[0]]
[Parliament. Mr Dromey sat on the NCCL executive committee from 1970 to][[0]]
[investigating PIE as part of Operation Fernbridge, launched after the][[0]]
[Jimmy Savile affair, with one source saying there is evidence that PIE][[0]]
[members were abusing children ‘on an industrial scale’.][[0]]
[Home Office is also carrying out a ‘thorough, independent][[0]]
[investigation’ into shocking claims that the Labour government of the][[0]]
[1970s may have helped finance the notorious group.][[0]]
[since December, when The Mail first investigated the NCCL’s links to][[0]]
[the paedophile lobby, we have been sending detailed questions to Miss][[0]]
[Harman, Miss Hewitt and Mr Dromey about their links to PIE and whether][[0]]
[they now regret supporting such a group.][[0]]

[A real-time reconstruction of an armed robbery on Twitter has led to a violent father and his son being jailed.][[0]]
[Terrance Clark, 50, has been sentenced to life in prison and his 27-year-old son Lewis received a 16-year prison sentence after the pair held a cash delivery driver at gunpoint in Epsom, Surrey, last year.][[1]]
[A month after the attack, Surrey Police re-staged the][[1]]
[crime on the social networking website, using photographs and maps to][[0]]
[recreate the events leading up to the incident.][[0]]
[Each incident was posted at the same time they took place on the day of the attack.][[0]]
[Violent pair: Terrance Clark, 50 (left) and his son Lewis, 27, (right) were jailed after a re-enactment of an armed robbery in Epsom, Surrey, on Twitter strengthened the case against them][[0]]
[Re-staging: Surrey Police begin the real-time re-enactment by asking followers if they could help with the investigation][[0]]
[The move, named Operation Jadeite, led to][[0]]
[40 calls, each with additional information about the crime which][[0]]
[strengthened the case used to convict them at Guildford Crown Court.][[0]]
[The pair viciously attacked James Smith in January 2013 and snatched a cashbox containing][[0]]
[They pulled the trigger of the gun, but when it failed to go off, they pistol-whipped the ex-soldier][[0]]
[The men knocked out his front teeth and injured his face and hands. He needed bone grafts and implants.][[0]]
[Afterwards, they fled in a white Chevrolet and dumped it on a road nearby.][[0]]
[Map: They appealed to members of the public living in the Tattenham Crescent area of Epsom, asking them to stay tuned so they could 'help the investigation'][[0]]
[Using the hashtags #tweconstruction and #opjadeite, the events of the morning of the robbery were tweeted in real-time by Surrey Police on March 1 in a bid to trace further witnesses.][[0]]
[The reconstruction began with an appeal to the force's followers, asking if they lived in the area surrounding the shop on Tattenham Crescent.][[0]]
[At 10.15am, they posted an image of the Chevrolet which was spotted circling the scene throughout the morning.][[0]]
[They uploaded another 12 tweets detailing the time the attack took place as well as the suspects' escape route.][[0]]
[Vehicle: The staging of events leading up to the robbery started at 10.15am and included a picture of a white Chevrolet that was seen circling the scene][[0]]
[Arrival: The force then reports the moment the delivery van, driven by victim James Smith, pulls up][[0]]
[The move helped collect evidence that][[1]]
[led to the pair being convicted of conspiracy to rob and possession of][[0]]
[an imitation fireman with criminal intent.][[0]]
[men, from Battersea, south London, had previous convictions for violent][[0]]
[offences including cash-in-transit robbery were sentenced following an eight-day trial last month][[1]]
[Chief Inspector Paul Rymarz said: 'The Clarks are clearly extremely][[0]]
[dangerous individuals and thankfully due to the verdict today are likely][[0]]
[to remain off the streets of Surrey for some time.][[0]]
[Terrance nor Lewis have shown a shred of remorse for this horrific][[0]]
[crime, which was committed for no other reason other than pure greed.][[0]]
['Although we cannot turn back the][[0]]
[clock for the victim, I hope the verdict today will go some way to allow][[0]]
[him and his family to move on for this horrendous ordeal.'][[0]]
[added: 'One month after the event occurred we were still appealing for][[0]]
[witnesses and we believed by using social media we would be able to][[0]]
[reach a large number of people very quickly.][[0]]
[Appeal: The scene of the crime, a Co-Op, was then posted on the social networking site][[0]]
[Terrifying moment: The passengers of the white Chevrolet in question jump out of the car to rob the driver at gunpoint. They knocked out his teeth when they pistol-whipped him][[0]]
['Following the social media appeal information was passed to the investigation team.'][[0]]
[delivery driver, James Smith told the court: 'No amount of training could ever prepare you for that experience.][[0]]
[is unbelievable how quickly your life can change. The little things you][[0]]
[once took for granted are taken away from you at no fault of your own.'][[0]]
[Clark was arrested within hours of the robbery and his son was arrested][[0]]
[after six days, but police then launched into a 'thorough' nine-month][[0]]
[the Twitter reconstruction, officers checked CCTV film, conducted][[0]]
[financial investigations and carried out mobile phone analysis.][[0]]
[Escape: Officers then trace the route the Chevrolet is believed to have taken on Google Maps][[0]]
[Surveillance footage: Surrey Police posted a grab of CCTV clip showing a 'vital witness'][[0]]
[Help: They then tweet a second picture of the potential witness, asking followers if it is their car they can see][[0]]

[Lesley Dunford was onvicted of the manslaughter of her three-year-old daughter after an inquest into the 2004 death was dramatically halted by a coroner][[0]]
[A 'remorseless' mother jailed for killing her three-year-old daughter had laughed and joked as the young girl lay dying in hospital, it emerged today.][[0]]
[Lesley Dunford, 33, was yesterday convicted of the manslaughter of her young daughter Lucy in 2004, eight years after a coroner dramatically halted the youngster's inquest.][[0]]
[Dunford, jailed for seven years yesterday, suffocated Lucy just six months after her seven-month-old son Harvey died in an apparent cot death, a court heard.][[0]]
[But it emerged today that Dunford laughed and joked with her youngest daughter just minutes after medics said they were losing the battle save Lucy.][[0]]
[The mother also telephoned a vicar and her husband before calling for an ambulance for her stricken daughter, according to The Sun.][[0]]
[Dunford's daughter Lucy was found with cuts and bruises on her neck and shoulders at the family home in Camber, East Sussex, in February 2004.][[1]]
[The three-year-old was rushed to Conquest Hospital in Hastings but could not be saved.][[0]]
[After conflicting post mortem reports, Dunford was arrested two days after Lucy's death, but a lack of evidence saw prosecutors drop the case.][[0]]
[She was rearrested when a coroner dramatically halted the youngster's inquest and forced police to reopen the investigation.][[0]]
[A judge told Dunford she had gone from 'carer to killer' when she inflicted fatal injuries on her young daughter in 2004.][[1]]
[A jury at Lewes Crown Court convicted Dunford of manslaughter but cleared her of murder.][[0]]
[Sentencing yesterday Judge Richard][[0]]
[Brown said: 'The jury have convicted you of manslaughter of your][[0]]
[three-year-old daughter Lucy.][[0]]
[may well be you are the only one who knows exactly what happened on][[0]]
[that dreadful day in 04 which took you from carer to killer.][[0]]
['Since then you have done your level best to lie your way out of any responsibility.][[0]]
['This indicates you have little or no remorse for what you did.'][[0]]
[original post mortem found that Lucy may have died from a sudden onset][[1]]
[of a bacterial infection which led to her choking on her own vomit.][[0]]
[Dunford's house in Camber, East Sussex, where her daughter Lucy was found not breathing with bruises][[0]]
[during a second examination this was disputed and the idea put forward][[0]]
[that suspicious bruising on the tot's upper body may mean her airways][[0]]
[At the time Dunford claimed her][[0]]
[daughter had been 'perfectly fine' earlier in the day but that she had][[0]]
[been tired so she had put her to bed - she later told paramedics she][[0]]
[thought her daughter had had a 'fit'.][[0]]
[she had found her daughter Dunfold refused to ring the emergency][[0]]
[services until she had spoken to her husband - whom she told 'it's][[0]]
[happened again' in reference to Lucy's younger brother Harley who had][[0]]
[been found dead in his cot six months previously.][[0]]
[Describing how Dunford later joked about her daughter in hospital, nurse Caroline Simpson, who was in a waiting room with the mother, said: 'The girl put a paper cup of water to her mouth but it spilled down her front.][[0]]
['The mum said, "She's always doing that". She appeared to find it quite hilarious.'][[0]]
[Paramedics at Conquest Hospital in][[0]]
[Hastings noticed two marks on her neck which had started to bruise and][[0]]
[requested the attendance of police at the hospital.][[0]]
[Dunford was arrested in February 2004 and interviewed by police then and again in May.][[0]]
[Her case was passed to the Crown Prosecution Service who decided there was not enough evidence to charge Dunford with the murder of Lucy.][[1]]
['This was a difficult and complex case that involved evidence from a number of medical experts.'][[0]]
[Simon Ringrose, CPS][[0]]
[But during her inquest in 2009 East Sussex coroner Alan Craze demanded the case was revisited.][[1]]
[inquest threw up new information which had been given by medical][[0]]
[experts in 2005 during a Family Court hearing into Lucy's death.][[0]]
[This information had not been passed on to the CPS. Dunford was then rearrested and charged in July 2011.][[0]]
[Prosecutor Sally Howes QC said during the trial that the inquest had 'excluded the likelihood' of a serious infection and found that injuries to the airways were consistent with an 'application of force'.][[0]]
[On July 12, 2011, Dunford was therefore rearrested and Ms Howes said she told officers: 'I have been waiting for this to happen.'][[0]]
[Dunford, 33, was arrested in February 2004 and interview by police then and again in May][[0]]
[During his sentencing Judge Brown told the court he took into account Dunford's 'childlike manner' and the 'long delay' in bringing the trial to court.][[0]]
[However he said courts have a duty to 'protect little people like Lucy from violence'.][[0]]
[Speaking afterwards, Detective Chief Inspector Nick Sloan, of the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team, said: 'There was a thorough police investigation at the time but the forensic evidence then did not support a prosecution.][[0]]
['The death of Lucy was immediately treated as suspicious by Sussex Police. Her mother was arrested and interviewed and there was a thorough investigation.][[0]]
['However, based on the information available at the time, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decision was that there was insufficient evidence to support a criminal prosecution.][[0]]
['The CPS decision turned largely on reports from two pathologists, which were conflicting.'][[0]]
[Simon Ringrose, of the CPS, said: 'This was a difficult and complex case that involved evidence from a number of medical experts.][[0]]
['The reinvestigation into the circumstances of Lucy Dunford's death included obtaining further medical evidence.][[0]]
['This evidence effectively ruled out a natural cause of death and was consistent with Lucy having been suffocated.][[0]]
['The only person who could have done this was her mother, Lesley Dunford.'][[0]]
[After the sentencing Wayne Dunford declined to comment.][[0]]

[Two Georgia brothers reported missing earlier this week have been found safe and well in Texas while their father has been arrested on abduction charges.][[0]]
[Police have been searching for Daniel Cleary, 46, and his two sons Ben, 9, and Henry, 7, after he failed to return the two boys to their mother in Suwanee on Wednesday.][[1]]
[On Friday police released surveillance photos which showed the three in a Walmart store in Chattanooga, Tennessee.][[0]]
[Found: Daniel Cleary, left, and his two sons, Henry and Ben, right, have been found. Police have arrested Cleary on abduction charges after he allegedly failed to return the boys to his ex-wife at the end of their week-long stay][[1]]
[An amber alert was issued for the boys after their mother Theresa Nash reported them missing.][[0]]
[She said she was particularly concerned as][[0]]
[Daniel Cleary had purchased a firearm about a month ago, was under][[0]]

['We have recovered the kids,' McGee said. 'They were with him and they were OK.'][[0]]
[Austin police said a citizen had recognized the boys from the alert and][[0]]
[notified police at 5:11 p.m. CDT that they were at a hotel.][[0]]

[Hunt: CCTV images were captured last Sunday and Monday while Cleary and the two boys, seen wearing blue vests, were on a planned trip to the Tennessee Aquarium][[1]]
[On Thursday, Roswell police issued the][[0]]

[discovering that Mr Cleary violated a court order by not communicating][[0]]
[with the boys' mother, Theresa Nash, for several days about the][[0]]
['He bought a Glock a month ago,' Theresa Nash told WTVM.][[0]]
['He is drinking. He is under extreme stress because he probably][[0]]
[realizes that he's kidnapped the kids and there's now an Amber Alert.'][[0]]
[The CCTV images released Friday][[0]]
[afternoon showed Mr Cleary with his children shopping at the][[0]]
[Chattanooga Walmart, captured on December 23 and 24.][[0]]
[Their father picked the kids up on December 19 and was supposed to return them to Nash by 2pm on December 26, but never made it.][[0]]
[Ms Nash last heard from her][[0]]
[ex-husband on December 22 when he called her to say that he and the boys][[0]]
[would be spending a night at a Quality Inn motel in Chattanooga,][[0]]
[Tennessee, after visiting the Tennessee Aquarium in town, according to 11Alive.][[0]]
[Distraught: The boys' mother, Theresa Nash, said her ex-husband, a recovering alcoholic, had recently bought a Glock handgun][[0]]
[Cleary made one final call from his cell phone on December 23 from Nashville, after which the device was shut off.][[0]]
[With mounting concern, Theresa Nash][[0]]
[drove to Roswell and went to Cleary’s home at 285 Crab Orchard Way, only][[0]]
[to discover that the house had been cleared out of TVs and other][[0]]
[Cleary’s car was later found abandoned in a restaurant parking lot.][[0]]
[Nash said that a friend of Cleary's confirmed to her that the 46-year-old man purchased a Glock handgun last month, and she said that police said that the firearm was on him.][[1]]
[The mother also added that Cleary, whom she described as an alcoholic, had recently undergone treatment at a rehab facility in California, KOLO8 reported. The man regained shared custody of Henry and Ben only in October, and the Christmas break was their first week alone with their father.][[1]]
[‘I can’t predict his behavior with logic. It always defies me when I try, so I don’t have certainty that he wouldn’t,’ she said. “He loves them very much but he is not of sound mind.’][[0]]
[According to court records obtained by Channel 2, Nash filed a petition for contempt against Cleary last November.][[0]]
[The document stated  that the woman smelled alcohol on his breath when he went to pick up the children, so she refused to let Cleary take them. The petition, however, was denied.][[0]]

[These despicable images show four men about to be put to death by ISIS in Iraq, apparently because they are spies.][[1]]
[The shocking pictures emerged just hours after campaign group CAGE defended Jihadi John, today unmasked as west London student Mohammed Emwazi, as 'beautiful' and a man who 'wouldn't hurt a fly'.][[1]]
[The scarcely believable comments about Emwazi were made by CAGE leader Asim Qureshi at a press conference in which he blamed MI5 for radicalising the University of Westminster graduate.][[0]]
[The victims are blindfolded and lined up ready to be shot by Islamic State fighters in the horrific images][[0]]
[The alleged spies, clearly terrified, are marched to their deaths under the murderous eyes of their killers][[0]]
[The ISIS fighters hold aloft the handguns with which they have just shot and killed the four 'spies', whose bodies are slumped before them on the ground][[1]]
[In the guise of Jihadi John, Emwazi has apparently been responsible for the beheadings of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, British aid worker David Haines and taxi driver Alan Henning, and American aid worker Abdul-Rahman Kassig, also known as Peter.][[0]]
[The gruesome murders were filmed, expertly edited and distributed in the name of Islamic State.][[0]]
[Jihadi John's trademark black hood can be seen covering the faces of the four executioners in the latest pictures, thought to have been taken in Salahuddin province in Iraq.][[0]]
[Each man was accused of being part of a spy ring and were executed under the crime of spying for the Baghdad government.][[0]]
[Clad in the familiar orange jumpsuits the victims, named as Sabi Khalif Mohammad al-Taghi, Mohammad Mahdi Salah al-Jamili, Abdullah Mahmoud Abdullah al-Khamili and Salwan Saidy Suleiman al-Jabouri, are pictured being marched into a clearing under the dark gaze of their killers.][[0]]
[Amid bright sunlight filtered through surrounding trees, they are photographed standing separately while their three alleged accomplices kneel with their heads down in the background.][[0]]

[Some of their faces show defiance and others fear, before they are lined up on their knees with their black-clad killers standing behind.][[0]]
[In gut-wrenching images the four are then seen slumped on the ground, apparently having been shot in cold blood, as their ISIS murderers raise hand guns in the air.][[1]]
[Blood pools around the heads of the dead men, which are shown in close-up in images too horrific to reproduce.][[0]]
[Earlier today Qureshi was branded an ISIS sympathiser as he appeared to launch a defence of Emwazi and his barbaric crimes.][[1]]
[He described Emwazi as 'the most humble young person that I knew', adding: 'He was such a beautiful young man, really.][[0]]
['It's hard to imagine the trajectory, but it is not a trajectory that's unfamiliar with us.][[0]]
['When are we going to finally learn that when we treat people as if they're outsiders, they are going to feel like outsiders and they will look for belonging elsewhere.'][[0]]
[About to meet his death, Mohammad Mahdi Salah al-Jamili is pictured handcuffed my the militants][[0]]
[The four, including Abdullah Mahmoud Abdullah al-Khamili, were killed because they were allegedly spies][[0]]
[He also revealed that he'd been in regular contact with Emwazi before he left for Syria.][[0]]
[In the wake of Emwazi's unmasking as the world's most wanted man, CAGE yesterday released a statement entitled 'Jihadi John: 'Radicalised' By Britain'.][[0]]
[The release stated that Emwazi 'desperately wanted to use the system to change his situation, but the system ultimately rejected him,' a view later echoed on CAGE's press conference, which was broadcast live on both BBC and Sky News.][[0]]
[Qureshi then used the statement to criticise the British security services, arguing that counter-terror measures turned young Muslims into extremists.][[0]]
[Other videos have emerged of Qureshi suggesting he is a jihadi apologist, including oneat an anti-US rally in London at which he is filmed urging protesters to 'support the jihad of our brothers and sisters' in Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine and Chechnya.][[0]]

[A mother has won a restraining order against her 'childish' next-door neighbour after a bitter 18-month dispute over wheelie bins culminated in him being arrested for allegedly attacking her.][[1]]
[Joanne Dowling, 42, of Aberdare, south Wales, became locked in a bin battle with neighbour Gary Jones, 58, after claiming he blocked her parking space with his garbage.][[1]]
[Heated words escalated after Jones smeared grease over Ms Dowling's bin handles before later allegedly lunging at her in her own home.][[0]]
[Garbage wars: Trainee solicitor Joanne Dowling, 42, of Aberdare, south Wales, became embroiled in a bitter dispute with next-door neighbour Gary Jones (R), 58, over their wheelie bins][[0]]
[According to trainee solicitor Ms Dowling, she had initially politely requested her next-door neighbour refrain from leaving his rubbish in front of her property.][[0]]
[After tensions mounted between the pair, Jones began to coat the handles of her wheelie bins with thick grease, preventing her from opening the lid to dispose of her garbage on collection days.][[0]]
[The extraordinary row came to a head when Ms Dowling opened her bin one day and found it was full of her neighbour's rubbish.][[0]]
[Jones and his family had filled it with leftover party decorations and half a birthday cake and when Ms Dowling found it, she flung it on to her neighbour's doorstep in anger.][[0]]
[She was then confronted by her neighbour's screaming daughters and later, a furious Jones banged on her door and allegedly lunged at her when she opened it, pushing her on to her sofa.][[0]]

[Ms Dowling said: 'Every day when I got home from work the neighbours would have deliberately obstructed my parking spot with their bin.][[0]]
['We live on a very narrow street so everyone keeps their wheelie bin tight to the front of their house but for some reason next door liked to keep their bin on my side.][[0]]
['They objected to me moving it out of the way and started to smear builders grease on the handle so I wouldn't touch it.][[0]]
['They also wrote signs warning me not to touch their bin. It was so childish.'][[0]]

[At-home DIY tattoo kits, otherwise known as 'stick and poke' tattoos, are predicted to be one of 2015's most popular cosmetic trends, despite official warnings from the FDA about the risks involved in at-home inking.][[1]]
[According to fashion website Style.com, stick and poke body art, which is created by repeatedly puncturing the skin with a needle that has been soaked in tattoo ink, is set to be one of the New Year's biggest crazes, thanks in large part to a range of budget-friendly kits currently being sold through a variety of retailers for just $40.][[1]]
['Tattoos are back and the coolest style to have is a stick and poke,' the website's shopping editor Steff Yotka wrote.][[0]]
[At-home inking: Stick and poke kits such as this one, from stickandpoketattookit.com, have become increasingly popular in recent months][[0]]

['...We trust that the stick and poke is going to stick in 2015.'][[0]]
[But the website's decision to encourage readers to try out the controversial trend has been met with outrage by some of its readers, who claim that DIY tattoos are 'ridiculous' and 'dangerous'.][[0]]
['In no way should you be encouraging anyone to tattoo themselves that is inexperienced, outside of a sterile shop, and not done by a professional,' user Kayti Hurd commented on Style.com's Facebook page.][[0]]
['Tattoos are lifelong markings, not some trend that you can ditch the next year when something new comes along. Shame.'][[0]]
[Amy Jessica Lipson added: 'Style??!! Jailhouse tattoos are the antithesis of good style. (Or common sense for that matter.)'][[0]]
[A spokesperson for the FDA told MailOnline that anyone wanting to try a stick and poke tattoo for themselves should first be aware of the risks involved in at-home inking.][[0]]
[Steady hand: The art of stick and poke tattooing involves puncturing the skin repeatedly with a needle that has been soaked in special ink][[0]]
['The most commonly reported problem involves microbiological contaminants, which may be introduced into bottles of ink during manufacturing or packaging, or when the inks are being prepared for injection,' FDA press officer Lauren Sucher said.][[0]]
['Injecting contaminated ink into the skin, using contaminated needles or poor site preparation may result in infections at the site of the tattoo that can spread throughout the body via the blood, a condition known as sepsis.][[0]]
['These infections can be severe and require extensive treatment with antibiotics, hospitalization, or surgery. Symptoms of illness after receiving a tattoo include redness, swelling, itching or blemishes in the tattoo, or pain in the tattoo that does not go away.][[0]]
['Once the infection has healed, the area may remain permanently scarred.][[0]]
['Other potential health threats may include increased sensitivity to sunlight or exposure to toxic constituents present in some inks.'][[0]]
[Let it go: Critics have hit out at the trend, claiming that it is 'ridiculous' and 'dangerous'][[0]]
[Ms Sucher added that the FDA have already recalled a large number of stick and poke kits, after they were found to contain toxic inks or unclean needles.][[0]]
['At-home tattooing can be more dangerous if the individual does not know how to select good quality inks and equipment including sterile needles,' she added.][[0]]
['If purchasing kits online for home use, consumers should not use and should dispose of tattoo inks and tattoo kits that have been recalled.][[1]]
['The consumer should know how to properly prepare the skin for tattooing and apply the ink. Proper pre- and post-tattooing hygiene and after care are important in preventing complications.'][[0]]
[Stick & Poke, a popular DIY tattoo kit brand, also warns customers against the potential dangers of at-home body art, urging people to ensure they are protected against toxic inks, unclean supplies and dirty needles, some of the most common causes of infection.][[0]]

[A cafe owner has outraged mothers and fathers after posting on social media that parents with badly-behaved children should steer clear of her cafe.][[0]]
[On Monday The Little French Cafe in Broadmeadow, Newcastle, north of Sydney, asked customers to refrain from bringing their unruly offspring into the establishment in a Facebook post, which has since been removed.][[1]]
[But the cafe's owner Jodie Morris said despite some parents taking aim at her stance, the response had been overwhelming positive _ and she stands by the post.][[0]]
['Everyone's said oh you're going to lose so much business but we're the busiest we've ever been,' Ms Morris told Daily Mail Australia.][[0]]
[Owner of The Little French Cafe Jodie Morris (pictured) wrote a message on Facebook warning customers to keep their unruly kids away from her cafe after being criticised for not being child-friendly][[0]]
[This post sparked controversy and debate among people, some who attacked the cafe owner for excluding parents][[0]]
[However Jodie Morris has stuck to her guns saying that she built the cafe on her own and has the right to dictate her clientele][[1]]
[In the post that kicked it all off the cafe owner said that she was not 'child-friendly' unless kids were willing to sit at the table without running around the cafe and disrupting other diners.][[0]]
['If you are looking for a cafe with a children’s menu, baby chinos, a play area, lounges for your children to jump on, vast space for your prams, an area for your children to run rampant, and annoy other customers, whilst you are oblivious to them - then the short answer is no we are not child friendly,' she wrote.][[1]]
[A mother herself, the owner stood by her comments in follow up posts declaring her rules had nothing to do with discrimination and everything to do with people being respectful.][[0]]
[The public declaration came after a customer gave her scathing one-star review, posing the question 'are you child friendly - because it doesn't seem like it'.][[0]]
[Jodie responded by saying that the cafe was situated in a prominent business area, and defended her position by stating that as the owner it was ultimately her decision to decide the clientele she wanted to attract.][[0]]
[Many people have come out in support of Jodie's decision, praising her honesty][[0]]
[The cafe owner insisted she wasn't discriminating as she has children of her own][[0]]
[Jodie said she was simply within her rights to remind people there's a time and a place for rowdy behaviour][[0]]
[However some people weren't too pleased with the stance, commenting that she should be able to take her kids anywhere][[0]]
[Others said it was excluding people and losing out on much of the market][[0]]
['I built the cafe myself. It has my blood sweat and plenty of tears in it. It is beautifully decorated, old fireplaces, French furniture, and we use fine old china etc,' she wrote.][[0]]
['I have been subjected to children emptying salt and pepper shakers into my fireplaces, parents changing nappies on my lounges, kids grinding their own food into my carpet, parents sitting babies in nappies in the middle of dining tables, kids running around the cafe like it's a formula 1 track, jumping on the furniture, screaming - just for fun - not pain, and encouraged by their parents, upsetting the rest of the customers and I'd really just had enough.][[1]]
['And yes, I am a mother. A single mother at that. Instead of being a "burden" on society, I scrimped every last penny and put it into this cafe, and I'm very proud of it. When I have to stand there and watch people disrespect and damage MY belongings and property, it breaks a piece of my heart every time.][[0]]
['Some will agree with my stance, some will not, but it's my stance for my business,' Jodie concluded.][[0]]
[And despite warnings from critics that defending what some parents called an 'attack' aimed at them would result in damage to the business, the cafe owner revealed that the controversy had the exact opposite effect.][[0]]
[The cafe owner revealed in one of her social media posts she 'built the cafe myself. It has my blood sweat and plenty of tears in it'][[0]]
[She also said she would welcome children who are well-behaved and won't ruin the place][[1]]
[The decision has sparked a fierce debate leaving vocal parents divided on the issue][[0]]
[Many social media users thought the stance would attract more customers][[0]]
[Some others criticised the parents of disruptive children][[0]]
[This person said they would make a special trip the cafe if they were even in the right state][[0]]
['It's definitely positive but there is also those out there that aren't happy .. I've never said no they can't come in I just said they have to be well-behaved ... Parents don't like to be told what to do with their kids.'][[0]]
['If they came to my house and behaved like that they wouldn't come back so why should they come back to my cafe?,' Jodie told Daily Mail Australia.][[0]]
['I am a parent, I understand there's a time and a place ... And somewhere where's there's tables and food and hot drinks is not the place.'][[0]]
[The comments on her latest Facebook post reflect this, with many people praising her decision to take a stand.][[0]]
[Robyn Gibson Borruso wrote: 'It is not a question of being 'child friendly' but more a question of being 'well-behaved child friendly'. I too am a mother of two children and have spent many years teaching my kids how to behave appropriately in restaurants.][[0]]
['Those parents who jump on their high horse about our 'house rules' are generally those ones who ignore their manic offspring while they disturb everyone else around them. Good on you for taking a stand!!'][[0]]
[Some customers jumped to Jodie's defence saying they wished more eateries would take a similar stance][[0]]
[Jodie revealed despite warnings the comments might hurt her business the cafe is booming][[0]]
[This person said not having children was their choice and reveled in the fact there was a place to go][[0]]
[While this user suggested a mass protest against Jodie][[0]]
[Emily agreed commending Jodie's honesty and openness.][[0]]
['I wish more Cafe's, Restaurants, and places in general took this stance in regards to unruly children and ignorant parents. Good on you! I will be sure to pop in for a coffee next time i'm in that way.'][[0]]
[However not all the responses were positive, with young dad Josh Hardes commented saying he would not tolerate being asked to leave if his child was behaving badly.][[0]]
['I have a 10 month old son and quite often enjoy going to cafes and restaurants with him and my wife.][[0]]
[My son may occasionally cry. Or be loud with his toys, but i do not tolerate someone telling me to leave, to keep him quiet, or try moving me to another area.][[0]]
['I'm there paying for a meal, not your opinion or to be judged by you or your staff. Some kids may be sick, may be having an off day, it may be their first time out in a situation like this so they will be excitable, give the parents the benefit of doubt.][[0]]
['Or you may just upset the wrong parent one day and the outcome may not be as expected,' Josh wrote.][[0]]

[Using a block of wood, some plexiglass and the lens from a laser pointer, a video shows how users can make a microscope with 175x magnification for an iPhone.][[1]]
[Once the project is completed, the smartphone can be used to take photos of things as small as the nuclei of plant cells as well as for macro photography projects.][[1]]
[One crafty DIY fan has revealed how to make a microscope for an iPhone using a few nuts and bolts, a piece of wood and plexiglass plus a torch and a lens taken from a laser pointer][[0]]
[According to crafting website Instructables, the DIY microscope can be made in just 20 minutes and costs under $10, excluding the price of the smartphone.][[1]]
[The lens for the microscope comes from a cheap laser pointer and the website explains how it can be freed from its casing and placed in the correct way against the camera lens of the iPhone using a hairpin.][[0]]

It is this lens that creates the larger field of view and can itself be used to take macro shots just pressed to the phone's camera lens][[0]]
[However, to create the microscope, a 'rig' must be built to keep the phone steady and it is made from a sheet of plywood for a base and a couple of pieces of plexiglass to make the camera stage as well as the place to put the specimens.][[0]]
[They are held in the correct position by carriage bolts and wing nuts.][[0]]
[The assembly of the rig requires basic DIY skills, including the use of a drill, as well as a few nuts and bolts.][[0]]
[A hole must be drilled in the camera stage just large enough for the lens to sit in and it is vital it is as close as possible to the camera.][[0]]
[According to Yoshinok, who penned the original how-to, plants cells can be seen really clearly under the home-made microscope. This is an image of red onion cells taken using an iPhone 4S with the DIY microscope attachment][[0]]
[Another hole is made directly below the lens for the light source - a small torch or LED light - and then the drilled components can be assembled into the final rig.][[0]]

[According to Yoshinok, who penned the original how-to and lives in Iowa, plants cells can be seen very clearly under the DIY microscope.][[0]]

[Cahill was frustrated afterwards with some of Chile’s underhand tactics and described one exchange with Eugenio Mena.][[0]]
[‘There was an incident where the left-back elbowed me and kicked out at me when I was trying to run past him for a cross, and I’ve got a yellow card,’ Cahill said. ‘I called him a cheat and he said, ‘Yeah, I’m a cheat, so what?’’ ’][[0]]

[It is a unique view of a sandstorm engulfing Dubai - taken from the top of the spire of the Burj Khalifa.][[0]]
[Daredevil photographer Gerald Donovan was given access to the spire to create a 360 degree panorama of the view - but instead had to deal with a huge storm.][[1]]
['Mission aborted - there's a storm coming in so we can't shoot,' he tells the camera in a YouTube video of the storm.][[0]]

['There are low, slow clouds travelling quite fast now, flowing in from the sea - I've never seen anything like that.'][[0]]
[He is also seen showing off the lightning conducting spire.][[0]]
['This is the lightning conductor - so we're maybe a little bit close to that -but there's no lightning at the moment,' he says, before clambering up onto the edge of the spire for a better view.][[0]]
['I'll just stand up here for a better view - it's a long way down.'][[0]]
[Eventually, even Mr Donovan admits it may be time to leave.][[0]]
['It's extremely windy, we can't go on with this.'][[0]]
[Mr Donovan then abandons the spire, to return later to complete his creation of a panoramic view of Dubai.][[0]]
[Composed of over 70 individual photos, it recreates the view Tom Cruise made famous as he sat at the tower’s peak during the filming of Mission Impossible Four, ‘Ghost Protocol’.][[1]]
[Navigate around the interactive image below (may not work on all mobile devices)][[0]]
[The top of the Burj Khalifa, developed by global property developer Emaar Properties, is over 200 metres above the highest point reached by the building’s elevators, which reach the 160th floor at speeds of some 10 metres per second.][[0]]
[The tower’s public observation deck is on the 124th floor.][[0]]
[The journey to the pinnacle involves a steep ladder climb within the 200-meter spire that crowns the building.][[0]]
[It takes in Dubai’s many landmarks, including the iconic Burj Al Arab hotel, the world’s biggest mall, the Dubai Mall and the Meydan Racecourse and shows the remarkable growth of a city still on a fast track to developing as a business hub and tourist destination.][[0]]
[Dubai based photographer Gerald Donovan created the shot using a mechanised panoramic tripod head to take a series of 48 panoramic images, each shot at a resolution of 80 megapixels.][[0]]

['I've always wanted to – ever since seeing the first designs of the building,' he told MailOnline.][[0]]
['The Burj Khalifa is a perfect building for shooting a 360 degree pano from the top of, because its 'roof' is only 1.5 meters across.][[0]]
['This means that you can shoot from a single location and capture the entire view, without the building itself getting in the way (aircraft beacons and lightning conductors excluded!).][[0]]
['I shot a 45 gigapixel panorama of the Dubai skyline in April 2010 – at the time, the world’s largest ever digital panorama, and thought that a panorama from the pinnacle of the Burj Khalifa would be a great way to top that.][[0]]
['As long as it was big enough to make it interesting to zoom around in, it didn’t need to be 10’s or 100’s of gigapixels.][[0]]
['It’s all about the view. Nothing can top that view – it is a unique place.][[0]]
['Since the time of the Great Pyramids, remarkably few buildings have held the title of 'World’s tallest structure on land'.][[0]]
['The Burj Khalifa is only the 15th in over 4,500 years of human history.][[0]]
['It’s a very, very special building, and hopefully people will appreciate it even more now that they can see the view from the top.][[0]]
['It’s all about being able to take people up there “virtually” and share what I experienced for real, and I hope people enjoy it!'][[0]]

[Earlier this year he was awarded the Family Values Award by the Mormon church for his work in promoting marriage.][[0]]
[But leaked details from ResPublica suggest Mr Blond has not always practised what he preaches.][[0]]
[He asked a fellow academic to give a Ukrainian woman he was pursuing £300 in cash.][[0]]
[academic responded: ‘What I could do is buy her a nice scarf or][[0]]
[something and put the cash in there so it’s not too obvious.’][[0]]
[Policy: David Cameron has pushed his 'Big Society' scheme but it has so far failed to capture the public's imagination][[0]]
[Friends said the money was to help the woman, who is now Mr Blond’s girlfriend, get over a burglary.][[0]]
[Mr Blond also spent £1,690 to fly out for a rendezvous with the woman at the Swiss Inn Resort in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt.][[0]]
[In March last year he flew to Brazil to meet another woman at the luxurious Porto Galinas resort, sending pictures of her in a bikini to his academic friend.][[1]]
[He also compared notes with his friend on a ‘hot Spanish journalist’ from a Catholic newspaper.][[0]]
[The details are believed to have been leaked by a disgruntled former member of staff.][[0]]
[Mr Blond, who rents a £4,100-a-month flat in the King’s Cross district of London, is paid a salary of £60,000.][[0]]
[But as ResPublica’s sole director and shareholder he is legally entitled to pay himself a hefty dividend from the profits.][[0]]
[The organisation’s accountants are said to have advised him to convert his £40,000 of personal spending into a dividend payment.][[0]]
[ResPublica said Mr Blond paid himself a ‘low base salary’, choosing to take the rest of his remuneration in dividends.][[0]]
[It apologised for an ‘oversight’ in not informing Mr Letwin who had paid for his hospitality at the opera.][[0]]

[Opposed: Lord Lester has said that controversial amendments to the Defamation Bill would damage free speech and break human rights laws if allowed to stand][[0]]
[Labour-inspired proposals on media law would curb the free Press in a way ‘never seen in any democratic country’, a senior peer warned last night.][[0]]
[Eminent QC Lord Lester said controversial amendments to the Defamation Bill pushed through with Labour support this month would damage free speech and break European human rights laws if they were allowed to stand.][[1]]
[He accused Labour of ‘hijacking’ the legislation in an attempt to force the Government to implement Lord Justice Leveson’s plans for regulation of the Press in the wake of the phone hacking scandal.][[1]]
[Ministers are said to be so concerned by the proposals that the entire piece of legislation could be abandoned.][[1]]
[But Lord Lester, the architect of the Defamation Bill, said this would be a travesty, as vital reforms of Britain’s notorious libel laws would also be lost.][[0]]
[His intervention comes amid growing Government anxiety about an amendment pushed through the Lords by 272 votes to 141 earlier this month.][[0]]
[The amendment, put forward by Labour-supporting film director Lord Puttnam, would introduce an arbitration service for members of the public wronged by  the Press.][[0]]
[The legislation would mean that newspapers that did not join the system could be punished by courts awarding potentially ruinous damages and costs.][[0]]
[Crossbench peer Lord Skidelsky, who is backing the move, yesterday suggested the arbitration system could help prevent the publication of ‘things which may be true, but whose publication has no sufficient reason’.][[0]]
[He suggested newspapers should face exemplary damages if they failed to get approval from the new regulator before publication.][[0]]
[But Lord Lester said this form of ‘prior restraint’ – which was demanded by former Formula One boss Max Mosley – was only used in a handful of former Soviet states.][[0]]
[Changes: The amendment to the Defamation Bill put forward by Lord Puttnam, left, followed Lord Leveson's report into press ethics][[0]]
[Lord Lester said the impact of the Puttnam amendments would be to introduce ‘a form of coercion I have not seen in any democratic country’.][[0]]
[Warning: David Cameron has warned that legislation could prove to be the thin end of the wedge and allow future politicians to interfere with Press freedom][[0]]
[He told the Daily Mail: ‘The scheme they are recommending would be totally incompatible with human rights and free speech. Instead of having self-regulation, which I believe strongly in, you would have a coerced system of arbitration.’][[0]]
[Lord Lester, a Liberal Democrat  peer, said the amendment was ‘inappropriate’ as it tacked controversial privacy issues on to legislation on libel reform which has cross-party support, including the stated support of Labour.][[0]]
[He added: ‘They have taken the Bill hostage in order to put pressure on the party leaders and the Press over the implementation of the Leveson reforms.][[0]]
['But Leveson wasn’t interested in libel law, he was interested in privacy.][[0]]
[‘I very much hope that when the Bill comes back to the Commons we can get agreement across the parties to release the Bill from the limbo it is now in so  that we can get these reforms onto the statute book.’][[0]]
[The Defamation Bill, which has all-party support, would bring in long-overdue reforms to Britain’s antiquated libel laws.][[0]]
[The political parties are still locked in stalemate over how to implement Lord Justice Leveson’s reforms.][[0]]
[Labour is demanding new laws to back up a new independent Press regulator.][[0]]
[But David Cameron has warned that legislation could prove to be the thin end of the wedge and allow future politicians to interfere with Press freedom.][[0]]
[He wants a new regulator to be established by Royal Charter.][[0]]

[Traditionally, a sandwich shop is a pretty good place  to work out where someone is from – do they order a roll, a bap or a barm?][[0]]
[These days, however, it might not be such an accurate marker.][[0]]
[Because wherever we live, more and more of us are now using ‘roll’, once a southern word.][[0]]
[Roll, barm or bap? Participants were shown a picture of everyday objects including a pair of trousers, a pair of shoes and what southerners would call a roll, and asked what word they would use for them][[1]]
[A survey found that while many regional divisions remain, they are slowly being worn away – particularly when it comes to the word for a soft piece of bread.][[0]]
[Linguistics researchers at Manchester University surveyed 1,400 people from Moray in Scotland down to Cornwall. They ranged in age from ten to 87.][[1]]
[The participants were shown a picture of everyday objects including a pair of trousers, a pair of shoes and what southerners would call a roll, and asked what word they would use for them.][[0]]
[The researchers then compared their results with maps put together several decades ago. The results showed that the word ‘bun’ is still common in Tyneside, ‘barm’ and ‘muffin’ are used in the][[0]]
[North West, ‘tea cake’ north of Manchester and ‘cob’ in the Midlands.][[0]]
[But the word ‘roll’ – which used to be used largely by those in the South East – is now used throughout the country, with more than a third of those who responded choosing it.][[0]]
[The southern word trousers is also used across the country, whereas the word ‘pants’ is restricted mostly to the North. The words ‘pumps’ and ‘plimsolls’ are used across the country, but the former is more prevalent in the North and the latter in the South.][[0]]
[Pronunciation is also becoming more southern. Dr Laurel MacKenzie, who led the study, said: ‘This research shows a clear North-South divide in many of the words we choose to use when describing everyday items, and the way we pronounce them.][[1]]
[North/South divide: The southern word trousers is also used across the country, whereas the word pants is restricted mostly to the North. The words pumps and plimsolls are used across the country, but the former is more prevalent in the North and the latter in the South][[0]]
[‘Variation is pervasive in language, and often correlates with social factors, like age, socio-economic status and a person’s place of origin.][[0]]
[‘However, we’ve compared our maps to those put together a few decades ago, and it looks like the southern pronunciation is slowly creeping northward.’][[0]]
[Despite that, there are still significant regional variations in pronunciation.][[0]]
[For example ‘one’ and ‘gone’ typically rhyme when spoken by northerners, but not southerners.][[0]]
[Those in the Midlands, meanwhile, could not make up their mind if they were northern or southern.][[0]]
[Like northerners, they rhyme ‘one’ and ‘gone’, but follow the South in failing to rhyme the words ‘foot’ and ‘strut’.][[0]]
[Dr MacKenzie added: ‘It’s not clear why different words are used to describe the same thing in different parts of the country.][[0]]
[‘There are sometimes anecdotal explanations – for instance, daps, the South West’s word for sports shoes, is said to be an abbreviation of Dunlop Athletic Plimsolls.’][[0]]
[The source of regional differences in pronunciation is often more clearly understood. Dr MacKenzie explained: ‘The northern way of rhyming the words ‘put’ and ‘cut’, for example, is faithful to how these words were pronounced centuries ago.][[0]]
[‘Speakers in the South moved away from this  pronunciation in the 1500s, but their way of saying these words didn’t make it to the North.’][[1]]

[Mesut Ozil owes Arsenal a big performance and what a place this would be to produce it. Back in his native Ruhr Valley, a world champion, making his 50th appearance in the Champions League. The stage seems perfectly set.][[1]]
[Arsene Wenger accepts there will be intense scrutiny on his German trio, but the 80,000 fans who ignite Borussia Dortmund’s Westfalen-stadion with their high-visibility traditional yellow colours and an incessant din are unlikely to provide a generous homecoming for the World Cup heroes.][[0]]
[Ozil is a product of fierce local rivals Schalke, 30 miles to the west, in Gelsenkirchen, although it is nearly seven years since he left for Werder Bremen and Real Madrid before Arsenal decided to invest a club record £42.5million in his talents.][[1]]
[Arsenal star Mesut Ozil has struggled since the end of last season][[1]]
[Mesut Ozil will be hoping his campaign can take off for Arsenal in Germany][[0]]
[Ozil has yet to be involved in a goal for Arsenal this year —either scoring or assisting. In the Premier League and Champions League last season, he was directly involved in 17 goals at a rate of one every other game.][[0]]
[He has not scored in 623 minutes of football for the north London club.][[0]]
[In 136 La Liga and Champions League games for Real Madrid, Ozil created 423 chances, including 61 assists. In his 37 games in the same competitions for Arsenal, he has created 102 chances and set up 11 goals.][[0]]
[Ozil began his career in Germany with Schalke and Werder Bremen but has not enjoyed playing back on home soil.][[0]]
[In five matches away to German sides, he has won just once, drawing one and losing three, including Real Madrid’s 4-1 thrashing by Borussia Dortmund in the 2013 Champions League semi-final.][[0]]
[Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp swerved the chance  to extol his qualities or to massage his confidence on the eve of such a vital fixture. ‘Even if he is a German player and a national, I don’t want to say anything about this,’ said Klopp. ‘That’s not an issue for me.’][[0]]
[Ozil is by some distance Arsenal’s most expensive signing and his flickering performances have been exposed by the instant impact of Alexis Sanchez, who arrived from Barcelona this summer for a mere £30m.][[0]]
[As Sanchez proved when he ripped off his shirt after scoring against Manchester City on Saturday, he is more muscular and robust and in this regard better equipped to resist the rigours of the English game.][[0]]
[Ozil’s more slender frame and subtle skills often seem in danger of being obliterated by the chaotic blur of the Premier League. Wenger, however, insists his contributions are too easily overlooked and he remains confident the 25-year-old will be successful in north London.][[0]]
[Perhaps it will be in Europe, in Champions League football where he starts to show his true value. With defensive issues piling up, this is one of those games when the Arsenal boss could do with his many creative forces combining to seize the initiative.][[0]]
[‘They did the best job with the transfers this summer,’ said Klopp, when asked about Arsenal’s summer spree.][[0]]
[Perhaps it will be in Europe, in Champions League football where he starts to show his true value. With defensive issues piling up, this is one of those games when the Arsenal boss could do with his many creative forces combining to seize the initiative.][[0]]

[Mesut Ozil celebrates scoring against Algeria in the World Cup, and his Arsenal anguish (above)][[0]]
[‘The squad has great stability and they are able to play the football Arsene Wenger wants to see, but they are even more serious because they have all options to close any spaces and are quick on the transition. 'They have players like Danny Welbeck and Ozil and Santi Cazorla, who has not played so much but shows great qualities when he plays.’][[0]]
[Last year, Wenger left Dortmund with three points after a stout defensive display and a goal from Aaron Ramsey, but this time it may have to be a different approach if they are to take the victory that would give them early control of Group D.][[0]]
[Klopp’s team are familiar foes. It will be the third time these clubs have met in the last four years in the group stages. The Bundesliga runners-up are riddled with injuries which have ruled out important players such as Ilkay Gundogan, Marco Reus, Jakub Blaszczykowski and Mats Hummels.][[0]]
[Mesut Ozil looked relaxed in training ahead of the clash with Borussia Dortmund][[0]]
[Per Mertesacker says Arsenal will look to put down a marker against Borussia Dortmund][[0]]
[Robert Lewandowski moved on to Bayern in the summer but Shinji Kagawa has lifted spirits since his return from Manchester United, scoring on his debut against Freiburg on Saturday.][[0]]
[‘It was sensational,’ said Klopp. ‘I was kind of surprised he was on the market once again. Maybe he didn’t fit in. We saw the chance and took it.’][[0]]
[It has been Arsenal’s failure to top the group which led them into the clutches of Bayern Munich and an exit at the first knockout stage in each of the last two years.][[0]]
[‘The first game will show where we’re at,’ said Gunners centre back Per Mertesacker. ‘The group is tough and we have to show from the start we are ready and focused.’][[0]]
[This Champions League will end in Germany, with a final in Berlin in June and, for three of the four English clubs involved, it starts against opposition from the Bundesliga.][[0]]
[The nation is on a football high after their triumph in Brazil and Wenger will hope to enjoy some of the benefit with Ozil, Lukas Podolski and Mertesacker thriving on the added motivation of a home final.][[0]]
[Arsene Wenger admits there's added pressure on his German players ahead of facing Borussia Dortmund][[0]]
[Arsenal’s Germans played more in Brazil’s than Dortmund’s, but an ankle injury ruled Ozil out of the homecoming games against Argentina and Scotland earlier this month, and Mertesacker quit international football after the World Cup.][[0]]
[‘It is always a pressure when you come back to your country,’ said Wenger. ‘The attention is a bit bigger, that’s for sure. Wojciech Szczesny would be under scrutiny in Poland.][[0]]
[‘It’s not such an advantage for us to have three German players because we know Dortmund anyway. We play them each year.][[0]]
[‘The World Cup final in Rio was on July 13 and they came back to training on August 11. That means I gave them one month of holiday. It was important for me that they would recover. They have been training for one month and haven’t reached 100 per cent physically yet. But they’re close.’][[0]]

[Tesco has suspended another three executives amid an investigation into its recent £250million overstatement of profit expectations.][[0]]
[It brings to eight the number of those asked to step aside since an inquiry into the error was launched last month by new boss Dave Lewis.][[1]]
[The fresh suspensions came as shares in the firm fell yet again in recent days - three weeks after it emerged the chain's sales had fallen at their fastest rate in more than 20 years with £2billion wiped off the retailer's market value.][[0]]

['We will provide an update on the investigation with our interim results on October 23.'][[0]]
[Four senior executives, including UK managing director Chris Bush, were asked to step aside last month when Tesco revealed that its most recent profits warning to the City in August was much too optimistic.][[1]]
[Mr Lewis said at the time that the suspensions would allow the company to carry out a 'full and frank' investigation and they were not disciplinary or an indication of guilt.][[0]]
[Last week it was reported that Tesco had also asked commercial director Kevin Grace to step aside pending the independent review by Deloitte.][[0]]
