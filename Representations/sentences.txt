-LSB-edit-RSB- History The common guinea pig was first domesticated as early as 5000 BC for food by tribes in the Andean region of South America -LRB-present-day Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia-RRB-, some thousands of years after the domestication of the South American camelids. Statues dating from ca. 500 BC to 500 AD that depict guinea pigs have been unearthed in archaeological digs in Peru and Ecuador. The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped animals and often depicted the guinea pig in their art. From ca. 1200 AD to the Spanish conquest in 1532, selective breeding resulted in many varieties of domestic guinea pigs, which form the basis for some of the modern domestic breeds. They continue to be a food source in the region; most households in the Andean highlands raise the animal, which subsists off the family's vegetable scraps. Folklore traditions involving guinea pigs are numerous; they are exchanged as gifts, used in customary social and religious ceremonies, and frequently referenced in spoken metaphors. They also play a role in traditional healing rituals by folk doctors, or curanderos, who use the animals to diagnose diseases such as jaundice, rheumatism, arthritis, and typhus. They are rubbed against the bodies of the sick, and are seen as a supernatural medium. Black guinea pigs are considered especially useful for diagnoses. The animal also may be cut open and its entrails examined to determine whether the cure was effective. These methods are widely accepted in many parts of the Andes, where Western medicine is either unavailable or distrusted. Spanish, Dutch, and English traders brought guinea pigs to Europe, where they quickly became popular as exotic pets among the upper classes and royalty, including Queen Elizabeth I. The earliest known written account of the guinea pig dates from 1547, in a description of the animal from Santo Domingo; because cavies are not native to Hispaniola, the animal was likely introduced there by Spanish travelers. The guinea pig was first described in the West in 1554 by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner. Its binomial scientific name was first used by Erxleben in 1777; it is an amalgam of Pallas' generic designation -LRB-1766-RRB- and Linnaeus' specific conferral -LRB-1758-RRB-. -LSB-edit-RSB- Name The scientific name of the common species is Cavia porcellus, with porcellus being Latin for ``little pig''. Cavia is New Latin; it is derived from cabiai, the animal's name in the language of the Galibi tribes once native to French Guiana. Cabiai may be an adaptation of the Portuguese çavia -LRB-now savia-RRB-, which is itself derived from the Tupi word saujá, meaning rat. Guinea pigs are called quwi or jaca in Quechua and cuy or cuyo -LRB-pl. cuyes, cuyos-RRB- in the Spanish of Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. Ironically, breeders tend to use the more formal ``cavy'' to describe the animal, while in scientific and laboratory contexts it is far more commonly referred to by the more colloquial ``guinea pig''. How the animals came to be thought of as ``pigs'' is not clear. They are built somewhat like pigs, with large heads relative to their bodies, stout necks, and rounded rumps with no tail of any consequence; some of the sounds they emit are very similar to those made by pigs, and they also spend a large amount of time eating. They can survive for long periods in small quarters, like a `pig pen', and were thus easily transported on ships to Europe. The animal's name carries porcine connotations in many European languages. The German word for them is Meerschweinchen, literally ``little sea pig'', which has been translated into Polish as świnka morska, into Hungarian as tengerimalac and into Russian as морская свинка which can be translated to English as ``sea pig''. This derives from nautical history: sailing ships stopping to reprovision in the New World would pick up stores of guinea pigs, which provided an easily transportable source of fresh meat. The French term is Cochon d'Inde -LRB-Indian pig-RRB- or cobaye; the Dutch used to call it guinees biggetje -LRB-Guinean piglet-RRB- or Spaanse rat -LRB-Spanish rat-RRB- in some dialects, and in Portuguese the guinea pig is variously referred to as cobaia, from the Tupi word via its Latinization, or as porquinho da Índia -LRB-little Indian pig-RRB-. This is not universal; for example, the common word in Spanish is conejillo de Indias -LRB-little rabbit of India / the Indies-RRB-. Equally peculiar, the Chinese refer to them as Holland pigs -LRB-荷蘭豬, hélánzhū-RRB-. The origin of ``guinea'' in ``guinea pig'' is harder to explain. One theory is that the animals were brought to Europe by way of Guinea, leading people to think they had originated there. ``Guinea'' was also frequently used in English to refer generally to any far-off, unknown country, and so the name may simply be a colorful reference to the animal's foreignness. Another theory suggests the ``guinea'' in the name is a corruption of ``Guiana'', an area in South America, though the animals are not native to that region. A common misconception is that they were so named because they were sold for the price of a guinea coin; this theory is untenable, because the guinea was first struck in England in 1663, and William Harvey used the term ``Ginny-pig'' as early as 1653. Others believe ``guinea'' may be an alteration of the word coney -LRB-rabbit-RRB-; guinea pigs were referred to as ``pig coneys'' in Edward Topsell's 1607 treatise on quadrupeds. -LSB-edit-RSB- Traits and environment Guinea pigs are large for rodents, weighing between 700 and 1200g -LRB-1.5-2.5�pounds-RRB-, and measuring between 20 and 25�cm -LRB-8--10�inches-RRB- in length. They typically live an average of four to five years, but may live as long as eight years. According to the 2006 Guinness Book of Records the longest living guinea pig survived 14�years, 10.5�months. In the 1990s, a minority scientific opinion emerged proposing that caviomorphs, such as guinea pigs, chinchillas, and degus, are not rodents and should be reclassified as a separate order of mammals -LRB-similar to lagomorphs-RRB-. Subsequent research using wider sampling has restored consensus among mammalian biologists that the current classification of rodents as monophyletic is justified. -LSB-edit-RSB- Natural habitat Cavia porcellus is not found naturally in the wild; it is likely descendant from some closely related species of cavies, such as Cavia aperea, Cavia fulgida, and Cavia tschudii, which are still commonly found in various regions of South America. Some species of cavy identified in the 20th century, such as Cavia anolaimae and Cavia guianae, may be domestic guinea pigs that have become feral by reintroduction into the wild. Wild cavies are found on grassy plains and occupy an ecological niche similar to that of the cow. They are social, living in the wild in small groups which consist of several females -LRB-sows-RRB-, a male -LRB-boar-RRB-, and the young -LRB-which in a break with the preceding porcine nomenclature are called pups-RRB-. They move together in groups -LRB-herds-RRB- eating grass or other vegetation, and do not store food. While they do not burrow or build nests, they frequently seek shelter in the burrows of other animals, as well as in crevices and tunnels formed by vegetation. They are crepuscular, tending to be most active during dawn and dusk, when it is harder for predators to spot them. -LSB-edit-RSB- Domestic habitat Domesticated guinea pigs thrive in groups of two or more; groups of sows, or groups of one or more sows and a neutered boar are common combinations. Guinea pigs learn to recognize and bond with other individual guinea pigs, and testing of boars shows that their neuroendocrine stress response is significantly lowered in the presence of a bonded female when compared to the presence of unfamiliar females. Groups of boars may also get along, provided that their cage has enough space, they are introduced at an early age, and no females are present. Domestic guinea pigs have developed a different biological rhythm from their wild counterparts, and have longer periods of activity followed by short periods of sleep in between. Activity is scattered randomly over the 24 hours of the day; aside from avoidance of intense light, no regular circadian patterns are apparent. Domestic guinea pigs generally live in cages, although some owners of large numbers of guinea pigs will dedicate entire rooms to their pets. Cages with solid or wire mesh floors are used, although wire mesh floors can cause injury and may be associated with an infection commonly known as bumblefoot -LRB-ulcerative pododermatitis-RRB-. ``Cubes and Coroplast'' -LRB-or C&C-RRB- style cages are now a common choice. Cages are often lined with wood shavings or a similar material. Bedding made from Red Cedar and pine, both softwoods, was commonly used in the past, however these materials are now believed to contain harmful phenols -LRB-aromatic hydrocarbons-RRB- and oils. Safer beddings include those made from hardwoods -LRB-such as aspen-RRB-, paper products, and corn cob materials are other alternatives. Guinea pigs tend to be messy within their cages; they often jump into their food bowls or kick bedding and feces into them, and their urine sometimes crystallizes on cage surfaces, making it difficult to remove. After its cage has been cleaned, a guinea pig will typically urinate and drag the lower body across the floor of the cage to mark its territory. Male guinea pigs may also mark their territory in this way when they are taken out of their cages. Guinea pigs do not generally thrive when housed with other species. Cohousing of guinea pigs with other rodents such as gerbils and hamsters may increase instances of respiratory and other infections, and such rodents may act aggressively toward the guinea pig. Larger animals may regard guinea pigs as prey, though some -LRB-such as dogs-RRB- can be trained to accept them. Opinion is divided over the cohousing of guinea pigs and domestic rabbits. Some published sources say that guinea pigs and rabbits complement each other well when sharing a cage. However, as lagomorphs, rabbits have different nutritional requirements, and so the two species cannot be fed the same food. Rabbits may also harbor diseases -LRB-such as the respiratory infections Bordetella and Pasteurella-RRB-, to which guinea pigs are susceptible. Even the dwarf rabbit is much stronger than the guinea pig and may cause intentional or inadvertent injury. -LSB-edit-RSB- Behavior Guinea pigs can learn complex paths to food, and can accurately remember a learned path for months. Their strongest problem solving strategy is motion. While guinea pigs can jump small obstacles, they are poor climbers, and are not particularly agile. They startle extremely easily, and will either freeze in place for long periods or run for cover with rapid, darting motions when they sense danger. Larger groups of startled guinea pigs will ``stampede'', running in haphazard directions as a means of confusing predators. When excited, guinea pigs may repeatedly perform little hops in the air -LRB-known as ``popcorning''-RRB-, a movement analogous to the ferret's war dance. They are also exceedingly good swimmers. Like many rodents, guinea pigs sometimes participate in social grooming, and they regularly self-groom. A milky-white substance is secreted from their eyes and rubbed into the hair during the grooming process. Groups of boars will often chew each other's hair, but this is a method of establishing hierarchy within a group, rather than a social gesture. Dominance is also established through biting -LRB-especially of the ears-RRB-, piloerection, aggressive noises, head thrusts, and leaping attacks. Non-sexual simulated mounting for dominance is also common among same-sex groups. Guinea pig sight is not as good as a human, but they have a wider range of vision -LRB-about 340°-RRB- and see in partial color -LRB-dichromacy-RRB-. They have well-developed senses of hearing, smell, and touch. Vocalization is the primary means of communication between members of the species. Some sounds are:  -LSB-edit-RSB- Breeding The guinea pig is able to breed year-round, with birth peaks usually coming in the spring; as many as five litters can be produced per year. The gestation period lasts from 59--72 days, with an average of 63--68 days. Because of the long gestation period and the large size of the pups, pregnant females may become large and eggplant-shaped, although the change in size and shape varies. Newborn pups are well-developed with hair, teeth, claws, and partial eyesight; they are immediately mobile, and begin eating solid food immediately, though they continue to suckle. Litters yield 1--6 pups, with an average of three; the largest recorded litter size is 17. In smaller litters, difficulties may occur during labour due to over-sized pups. Large litters result in higher incidences of stillbirth, but because the pups are delivered at an advanced stage of development, lack of access to the mother's milk has little effect on the mortality rate of newborns. Cohabitating females assist in mothering duties if lactating. Male and female guinea pigs do not differ in external appearance apart from general size. The position of the anus is very close to the genitals in both sexes. Female genitals are distinguished by a Y-shaped configuration formed from a vulvar flap; while the male genitals may look similar with the penis and anus forming a like shape, the penis will protrude if pressure is applied to the surrounding hair. The male's testes may also be visible externally from scrotal swelling. Males reach sexual maturity at 3--5 weeks; females can be fertile as early as four weeks and can carry litters before they are adults. Females that have never given birth commonly develop irreversible fusing of the pubic symphysis, a joint in the pelvis, after six months of age. If they become pregnant after this has happened, the birth canal will not widen sufficiently; this may lead to dystocia and death as they attempt to give birth. Females can become pregnant 6--48 hours after giving birth, but it is not healthy for a female to be thus constantly pregnant. Toxemia of pregnancy is common and kills many pregnant females. Signs of toxemia include anorexia, lack of energy, excessive salivation, a sweet or fruity breath odor due to ketones, and seizures in advanced cases. Pregnancy toxemia appears to be most common in hot climates. Other serious complications of pregnancy can include a prolapsed uterus, hypocalcaemia, and mastitis. -LSB-edit-RSB- Diet Grass is the guinea pig's natural diet. Their molars are particularly suited for grinding plant matter, and grow continuously throughout the animal's life. Most grass-eating mammals are quite large and have a long digestive tract; while guinea pigs have much longer colons than most rodents, they must also supplement their diet by coprophagy, the eating of their own feces. However, they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately, but produce special soft pellets, called cecotropes, which recycle B vitamins, fiber, and bacteria required for proper digestion. The cecotropes -LRB-or caecal pellets-RRB- are eaten directly from the anus, unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese. They share this behaviour with rabbits. In geriatric boars or sows -LRB-the condition is rarer in young ones-RRB-, the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus for consumption can become weak. This creates a condition known as anal impaction, which prevents the boar from redigesting cecotropes, though harder pellets may pass through the impacted mass. The condition may be temporarily alleviated by carefully expelling the impacted feces. Guinea pigs benefit from feeding on fresh grass hay, such as timothy hay, in addition to food pellets which are often based from timothy. Alfalfa is also a popular food choice; most guinea pigs will eat large amounts of alfalfa when offered it, though there exists some controversy over the feeding of alfalfa to adult guinea pigs. Some pet owners and veterinary organizations have advised that, as a legume rather than a grass hay, alfalfa consumed in large amounts may lead to obesity, as well as bladder stones due to excess calcium, in any but pregnant and very young guinea pigs. However, published scientific sources mention alfalfa as a source for replenishment of protein, amino acids, and fiber. Like humans, but unlike most other mammals, guinea pigs cannot synthesize their own vitamin C and must obtain this vital nutrient from food. If guinea pigs do not ingest enough vitamin C, they can suffer from potentially fatal scurvy. Guinea pigs require about 10�mg -LRB-0.15�gr-RRB- of vitamin C daily -LRB-20�mg -LRB-0.31�gr-RRB- if pregnant-RRB-, which can be obtained through fresh, raw fruits and vegetables -LRB-such as broccoli, apple, cabbage, carrot, celery, and spinach-RRB- or through dietary supplements. Healthy diets for guinea pigs require a complex balance of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and hydrogen ions; adequate amounts of vitamins E, A, and D are also necessary. Imbalanced diets have been associated with muscular dystrophy, metastatic calcification, difficulties with pregnancy, vitamin deficiencies, and teeth problems. Guinea pigs tend to be fickle eaters when it comes to fresh fruits and vegetables, having learned early in life what is and is not appropriate to consume, and their habits are difficult to change after maturity. They do not respond well to sudden changes in diet; they may stop eating and starve rather than accepting new food types. A constant supply of hay or other food is generally recommended, as guinea pigs feed continuously and may develop habits such as chewing on their own hair if food is not present. Because guinea pigs' teeth grow constantly, they routinely gnaw, lest their teeth become too large for their mouth, a common problem in rodents. Guinea pigs will also chew on cloth, paper, plastic, and rubber. A number of plants are poisonous to guinea pigs, including bracken, bryony, buttercup, charlock, deadly nightshade, foxglove, hellebore, hemlock, Lily of the Valley, mayweed, monkshood, privet, ragwort, rhubarb, speedwell, toadflax, and wild celery. Additionally, any plant which grows from a bulb -LRB-e.g., tulip and onion-RRB- is normally considered poisonous. -LSB-edit-RSB- Health Common ailments in domestic guinea pigs include respiratory tract infections, diarrhea, scurvy -LRB-vitamin C deficiency, typically characterized by sluggishness-RRB-, abscesses due to infection -LRB-often in the neck, due to hay embedded in the throat, or from external scratches-RRB-, and infections by lice, mites, or fungus. Mange mites -LRB-Trixacarus caviae-RRB- are a common cause of hair loss, and other symptoms may also include excessive scratching, unusually aggressive behavior when touched -LRB-due to pain-RRB-, and, in some instances, seizures. Guinea pigs may also suffer from ``running lice'' -LRB-Gliricola porcelli-RRB-, a small white insect which can be seen moving through the hair; the eggs of these lice, which appear as black or white specks attached to the hair, are sometimes referred to as ``static lice''. Giving a bath with neem oil soap is a gentle and effective way of ridding the pig of lice. Other causes of hair loss can be due to hormonal upsets caused by underlying medical conditions such as ovarian cysts. Neem oil is an effective treatment for the parasitic skin problems in pet Guinea Pigs, at a dilution rate of four parts of carrier oil to one part of Neem oil. Foreign bodies, especially small pieces of hay or straw, can become lodged in the eyes of guinea pigs, resulting in excessive blinking, tearing, and in some cases an opaque film over the eye due to corneal ulcer. Hay or straw dust can also cause sneezing. While it is normal for guinea pigs to sneeze periodically, frequent sneezing may be a symptom of pneumonia, especially in response to atmospheric changes. Pneumonia may also be accompanied by torticollis and can be fatal. Because the guinea pig has a stout, compact body, the animal more easily tolerates excessive cold than excessive heat. Its normal body temperature is 101--104�°F -LRB-38--40�°C-RRB-, and so its ideal ambient air temperature range is similar to the human's, about 65--75�°F -LRB-18--24�°C-RRB-. Consistent ambient temperatures in excess of 90�°F -LRB-32�°C-RRB- have been linked to hyperthermia and death, especially among pregnant sows. Guinea pigs are not well suited to environments that feature wind or frequent drafts, and respond poorly to extremes of humidity outside of the range of 30--70%. Guinea pigs are prey animals whose survival instinct is to mask pain and signs of illness, and many times health problems may not be apparent until a condition is severe or in its advanced stages. Treatment of disease is made more difficult by the extreme sensitivity guinea pigs have to most antibiotics, including penicillin, which kill off the intestinal flora and quickly bring on episodes of diarrhea and in some cases, death. Similar to the inherited genetic diseases of other breeds of animal -LRB-such as hip dysplasia in canines-RRB-, a number of genetic abnormalities of guinea pigs have been reported. Most commonly, the roan coloration of Abyssinian guinea pigs is associated with congenital eye disorders and problems with the digestive system. Other genetic disorders include ``waltzing disease'' -LRB-deafness coupled with a tendency to run in circles-RRB-, palsy, and tremor conditions. -LSB-edit-RSB- Pets If handled correctly early in their life, guinea pigs become amenable to being picked up and carried, and seldom bite or scratch. They are timid explorers, and rarely attempt to escape from their cages, even when an opportunity presents itself. Guinea pigs who become familiar with their owner will whistle on the owner's approach; they will also learn to whistle in response to the rustling of plastic bags or the opening of refrigerator doors, where their food is most commonly stored. Domesticated guinea pigs come in many breeds, which have been developed since their introduction to Europe and North America. These varieties vary in hair and color composition. The most common varieties found in pet stores are the English shorthair -LRB-also known as the American-RRB-, which have a short, smooth coat, and the Abyssinian, whose coat is ruffled with cowlicks, or rosettes. Also popular among breeders are the Peruvian and the Sheltie -LRB-or Silkie-RRB-, both straight longhair breeds, and the Texel, a curly longhair. Cavy Clubs and Associations dedicated to the showing and breeding of guinea pigs have been established worldwide. The American Cavy Breeders Association, an adjunct to the American Rabbit Breeders' Association, is the governing body in the United States and Canada. The British Cavy Council governs cavy clubs in the United Kingdom. Similar organizations exist in Australia -LRB-Australian National Cavy Council-RRB- and New Zealand -LRB-New Zealand Cavy Club-RRB-. Each club publishes its own Standard of Perfection and determines which breeds are eligible for showing. -LSB-edit-RSB- Cultural and media influence As a result of their widespread popularity in human domestic life, and especially because of their popularity in households with children, guinea pigs have shown a presence in culture and media. Some noted appearances of the animal in literature are The Fairy Caravan, a novel by Beatrix Potter, and Michael Bond's Olga da Polga series for children, both of which feature guinea pigs as the central protagonist. Another appearance is in The Magician's Nephew by C. S. Lewis: in the first -LRB-chronologically-RRB- of his The Chronicles of Narnia series, a guinea pig is the first creature to travel to the Wood between the Worlds. The short story Pigs Is Pigs by Ellis Parker Butler is a tale of bureaucratic incompetence; two guinea pigs held at a train station breed unchecked while humans argue as to whether they are ``pigs'' for the purpose of determining freight charges. In the Golden Hamster Saga books, there are two guinea pigs named Enrico and Caruso who are modern-day thespians -LRB-named after Enrico Caruso-RRB- who serve as secondary characters, and often irritate the main character, Freddy Auratus who strongly dislikes their acting antics. Guinea pigs have also been featured in film and television. In the TV movie Shredderman Rules, the main character and the main character's crush both have guinea pigs which both play a minor part in the plot. A guinea pig named Rodney, voiced by Chris Rock, was a prominent character in the 1998 film Dr. Dolittle and Linny the Guinea pig is a co-star on Nick Jr.'s Wonder Pets. Guinea pigs were used in some major advertising campaigns in the 1990s and 2000s, notably for Egg Banking plc, Snapple, and Blockbuster Video. The Blockbuster campaign is considered by some guinea pig advocates to have been a factor in the rise of cohousing guinea pigs and rabbits. In the South Park season 12 episode ``Pandemic 2: The Startling'',giant guinea pigs dressed in costumes, are portrayed as rampaging over the entire Earth. The Walt Disney Pictures movie G-Force, released in the United States on July 24, 2009, features a group of highly intelligent guinea pigs trained as operatives of the U.S. government. -LSB-edit-RSB- Scientific research The use of guinea pigs in scientific experimentation dates back at least to the 17th century, when the Italian biologists Marcello Malpighi and Carlo Fracassati conducted vivisections of guinea pigs in their examinations of anatomic structures. In 1780, Antoine Lavoisier used a guinea pig in his experiments with the calorimeter, a device used to measure heat production. The heat from the guinea pig's respiration melted snow surrounding the calorimeter, showing that respiratory gas exchange is a combustion, similar to a candle burning. Guinea pigs played a major role in the establishment of germ theory in the late 19th century, through the experiments of Louis Pasteur, Émile Roux, and Robert Koch. Guinea pigs have been launched into orbital space-flight several times, first by the USSR on the Sputnik 9 biosatellite of March 9, 1961 - with a successful recovery. China also launched and recovered a biosatellite in 1990 which included guinea pigs as passengers. In English, the term guinea pig is commonly used as a metaphor for a subject of scientific experimentation, or any experiment or test in modern times. This dates back to the early 20th century; the Oxford English Dictionary notes its first usage in this capacity in 1913. In 1933, Consumers Research founders F. J. Schlink and Arthur Kallet wrote a book entitled 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs, extending the metaphor to consumer society. The book became a national bestseller in the United States, thus further popularizing the term, and spurred the growth of the consumer protection movement. The negative connotation of the term was later employed in the novel The Guinea Pigs by Czech author Ludvík Vaculík as an allegory for Soviet totalitarianism. Guinea pigs were popular laboratory animals until the later 20th century; about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the U.S. for research in the 1960s, but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s. As of 2007, they constitute approximately 2% of the current total of laboratory animals. In the past they were widely used to standardize vaccines and antiviral agents; they were also often employed in studies on the production of antibodies in response to extreme allergic reactions, or anaphylaxis. Less common uses included research in pharmacology and irradiation. Since the middle 20th century, they have been replaced in laboratory contexts primarily by mice and rats. This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents, although geneticists W. E. Castle and Sewall Wright made a number of contributions to this area of study, especially regarding coat color. In 2004, the U.S.'s National Human Genome Research Institute announced plans to sequence the genome of the domestic guinea pig. The guinea pig was most extensively implemented in research and diagnosis of infectious diseases. Common uses included identification of brucellosis, Chagas disease, cholera, diphtheria, foot-and-mouth disease, glanders, Q fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and various strains of typhus. They are still frequently used to diagnose tuberculosis, since they are easily infected by human tuberculosis bacteria. Because guinea pigs are one of the few animals which, like humans, cannot synthesize vitamin C but must obtain it from their diet, they are ideal for researching scurvy. From the accidental discovery in 1907 that scurvy could be induced in guinea pigs, to their use to prove the chemical structure of the ``ascorbutic factor'' in 1932, the guinea pig model proved a crucial part of vitamin C research. Complement, an important component for serology, was first isolated from the blood of the guinea pig. Guinea pigs have an unusual insulin mutation, and are a suitable species for the generation of anti-insulin antibodies. Present at a level 10 times that found in other mammals, the insulin in guinea pigs may be important in growth regulation, a role usually played by growth hormone. Additionally, guinea pigs have been identified as model organisms for the study of juvenile diabetes and, because of the frequency of pregnancy toxemia, of pre-eclampsia in human females. Guinea pig strains used in scientific research are primarily outbred strains. Aside from the common American or English stock, the two main outbred strains in laboratory use are the Hartley and Dunkin-Hartley; these English strains are albino, although pigmented strains are also available. Inbred strains are less common and are usually used for very specific research, such as immune system molecular biology. Of the inbred strains that have been created, the two that are still used with any frequency are, following Sewall Wright's designations, ``Strain 2'' and ``Strain 13''. Hairless breeds of guinea pigs have been used in scientific research since the 1980s, particularly for dermatological studies. A hairless and immunodeficient breed was the result of a spontaneous genetic mutation in inbred laboratory strains from the Hartley stock at the Eastman Kodak Company in 1979. An immunocompetent hairless breed was also identified by the Institute Armand Frappier in 1978, and Charles River Laboratories has reproduced this breed for research since 1982. Cavy fanciers then began acquiring hairless breeds, and the pet hairless varieties are referred to as ``skinny pigs''. -LSB-edit-RSB- As food Guinea pigs -LRB-called cuy, cuye, curí-RRB- were originally domesticated for their meat in the Andes. Traditionally, the animal was usually reserved for ceremonial meals by indigenous people in the Andean highlands, but since the 1960s it has become more socially acceptable for consumption by all people. It continues to be a major part of the diet in Peru and Bolivia, particularly in the Andes Mountains highlands; it is also eaten in some areas of Ecuador -LRB-mainly in the Sierra-RRB- and Colombia. Because guinea pigs require much less room than traditional livestock and reproduce extremely quickly, they are a more profitable source of food and income than many traditional stock animals, such as pigs and cows; moreover, they can be raised in an urban environment. Both rural and urban families raise guinea pigs for supplementary income, and the animals are commonly bought and sold at local markets and large-scale municipal fairs. Guinea pig meat is high in protein and low in fat and cholesterol, and is described as being similar to rabbit and the dark meat of chicken. The animal may be served fried -LRB-chactado or frito-RRB-, broiled -LRB-asado-RRB-, or roasted -LRB-al horno-RRB-, and in urban restaurants may also be served in a casserole or a fricassee. Ecuadorians commonly consume sopa or locro de cuy, a soup dish. Pachamanca or huatia, a process similar to barbecueing, is also popular, and is usually served with corn beer -LRB-chicha-RRB- in traditional settings. Peruvians consume an estimated 65 million guinea pigs each year, and the animal is so entrenched in the culture that one famous painting of the Last Supper in the main cathedral in Cusco shows Christ and the twelve disciples dining on guinea pig. The animal remains an important aspect of certain religious events in both rural and urban areas of Peru. A religious celebration known as jaca tsariy -LRB-``collecting the cuys''-RRB- is a major festival in many villages in the Antonio Raimondi province of eastern Peru, and is celebrated in smaller ceremonies in Lima. It is a syncretistic event, combining elements of Catholicism and pre-Columbian religious practices, and revolves around the celebration of local patron saints. The exact form that the jaca tsariy takes differs from town to town; in some localities, a sirvinti -LRB-servant-RRB- is appointed to go from door to door, collecting donations of guinea pigs, while in others, guinea pigs may be brought to a communal area to be released in a mock bullfight. Meals such as cuy chactado are always served as part of these festivities, and the killing and serving of the animal is framed by some communities as a symbolic satire of local politicians or important figures. In the Tungurahua and Cotopaxi provinces of central Ecuador, guinea pigs are employed in the celebrations surrounding the feast of Corpus Christi as part of the Ensayo, which is a community meal, and the Octava, where castillos -LRB-greased poles-RRB- are erected with prizes tied to the crossbars, from which several guinea pigs may be hung. The Peruvian town of Churin has an annual festival which involves dressing guinea pigs in elaborate costumes for a competition. Andean immigrants in New York City raise and sell guinea pigs for meat, and some ethnic restaurants in major United States cities serve cuy as a delicacy. Peruvian research universities, especially La Molina National Agrarian University, began experimental programs in the 1960s with the intention of breeding larger-sized guinea pigs. Subsequent university efforts have sought to change breeding and husbandry procedures in South America, in order to make the raising of guinea pigs as livestock more economically sustainable. In the 1990s and 2000s, the university began exporting the larger breed guinea pigs to Europe, Japan, and the United States in the hope of increasing human consumption outside of these countries in northern South America. Efforts have also been made to introduce guinea pig husbandry in developing countries in West Africa.

Efforts have also been made to introduce guinea pig husbandry in developing countries in West Africa. -LSB-edit-RSB- History The nucleus was the first organelle to be discovered. The probably oldest preserved drawing dates back to the early microscopist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek -LRB-1632 -- 1723-RRB-. He observed a ``Lumen'', the nucleus, in the red blood cells of salmon . Unlike mammalian red blood cells, those of other vertebrates still possess nuclei. The nucleus was also described by Franz Bauer in 1804 and in more detail in 1831 by Scottish botanist Robert Brown in a talk at the Linnean Society of London. Brown was studying orchids microscopically when he observed an opaque area, which he called the areola or nucleus, in the cells of the flower's outer layer. He did not suggest a potential function. In 1838 Matthias Schleiden proposed that the nucleus plays a role in generating cells, thus he introduced the name ``Cytoblast'' -LRB-cell builder-RRB-. He believed that he had observed new cells assembling around ``cytoblasts''. Franz Meyen was a strong opponent of this view having already described cells multiplying by division and believing that many cells would have no nuclei. The idea that cells can be generated de novo, by the ``cytoblast'' or otherwise, contradicted work by Robert Remak -LRB-1852-RRB- and Rudolf Virchow -LRB-1855-RRB- who decisively propagated the new paradigm that cells are generated solely by cells -LRB-``Omnis cellula e cellula''-RRB-. The function of the nucleus remained unclear. Between 1876 and 1878 Oscar Hertwig published several studies on the fertilization of sea urchin eggs, showing that the nucleus of the sperm enters the oocyte and fuses with its nucleus. This was the first time it was suggested that an individual develops from a -LRB-single-RRB- nucleated cell. This was in contradiction to Ernst Haeckel's theory that the complete phylogeny of a species would be repeated during embryonic development, including generation of the first nucleated cell from a ``Monerula'', a structureless mass of primordial mucus -LRB-``Urschleim''-RRB-. Therefore, the necessity of the sperm nucleus for fertilization was discussed for quite some time. However, Hertwig confirmed his observation in other animal groups, e.g. amphibians and molluscs. Eduard Strasburger produced the same results for plants -LRB-1884-RRB-. This paved the way to assign the nucleus an important role in heredity. In 1873 August Weismann postulated the equivalence of the maternal and paternal germ cells for heredity. The function of the nucleus as carrier of genetic information became clear only later, after mitosis was discovered and the Mendelian rules were rediscovered at the beginning of the 20th century; the chromosome theory of heredity was developed. -LSB-edit-RSB- Structures The nucleus is the largest cellular organelle in animals. In mammalian cells, the average diameter of the nucleus is approximately 6 micrometers -LRB-μm-RRB-, which occupies about 10% of the total cell volume. The viscous liquid within it is called nucleoplasm, and is similar in composition to the cytosol found outside the nucleus. It appears as a dense, roughly spherical organelle. -LSB-edit-RSB- Nuclear envelope and pores The nuclear envelope otherwise known as nuclear membrane consists of two cellular membranes, an inner and an outer membrane, arranged parallel to one another and separated by 10 to 50 nanometers -LRB-nm-RRB-. The nuclear envelope completely encloses the nucleus and separates the cell's genetic material from the surrounding cytoplasm, serving as a barrier to prevent macromolecules from diffusing freely between the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm. The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum -LRB-RER-RRB-, and is similarly studded with ribosomes. The space between the membranes is called the perinuclear space and is continuous with the RER lumen. Nuclear pores, which provide aqueous channels through the envelope, are composed of multiple proteins, collectively referred to as nucleoporins. The pores are about 125 million daltons in molecular weight and consist of around 50 -LRB-in yeast-RRB- to 100 proteins -LRB-in vertebrates-RRB-. The pores are 100 nm in total diameter; however, the gap through which molecules freely diffuse is only about 9 nm wide, due to the presence of regulatory systems within the center of the pore. This size allows the free passage of small water-soluble molecules while preventing larger molecules, such as nucleic acids and larger proteins, from inappropriately entering or exiting the nucleus. These large molecules must be actively transported into the nucleus instead. The nucleus of a typical mammalian cell will have about 3000 to 4000 pores throughout its envelope, each of which contains a donut-shaped, eightfold-symmetric ring-shaped structure at a position where the inner and outer membranes fuse. Attached to the ring is a structure called the nuclear basket that extends into the nucleoplasm, and a series of filamentous extensions that reach into the cytoplasm. Both structures serve to mediate binding to nuclear transport proteins. Most proteins, ribosomal subunits, and some RNAs are transported through the pore complexes in a process mediated by a family of transport factors known as karyopherins. Those karyopherins that mediate movement into the nucleus are also called importins, while those that mediate movement out of the nucleus are called exportins. Most karyopherins interact directly with their cargo, although some use adaptor proteins. Steroid hormones such as cortisol and aldosterone, as well as other small lipid-soluble molecules involved in intercellular signaling can diffuse through the cell membrane and into the cytoplasm, where they bind nuclear receptor proteins that are trafficked into the nucleus. There they serve as transcription factors when bound to their ligand; in the absence of ligand many such receptors function as histone deacetylases that repress gene expression. -LSB-edit-RSB- Nuclear lamina In animal cells, two networks of intermediate filaments provide the nucleus with mechanical support: the nuclear lamina forms an organized meshwork on the internal face of the envelope, while less organized support is provided on the cytosolic face of the envelope. Both systems provide structural support for the nuclear envelope and anchoring sites for chromosomes and nuclear pores. The nuclear lamina is mostly composed of lamin proteins. Like all proteins, lamins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and later transported into the nucleus interior, where they are assembled before being incorporated into the existing network of nuclear lamina. Lamins are also found inside the nucleoplasm where they form another regular structure, known as the nucleoplasmic veil, that is visible using fluorescence microscopy. The actual function of the veil is not clear, although it is excluded from the nucleolus and is present during interphase. The lamin structures that make up the veil bind chromatin and disrupting their structure inhibits transcription of protein-coding genes. Like the components of other intermediate filaments, the lamin monomer contains an alpha-helical domain used by two monomers to coil around each other, forming a dimer structure called a coiled coil. Two of these dimer structures then join side by side, in an antiparallel arrangement, to form a tetramer called a protofilament. Eight of these protofilaments form a lateral arrangement that is twisted to form a ropelike filament. These filaments can be assembled or disassembled in a dynamic manner, meaning that changes in the length of the filament depend on the competing rates of filament addition and removal. Mutations in lamin genes leading to defects in filament assembly are known as laminopathies. The most notable laminopathy is the family of diseases known as progeria, which causes the appearance of premature aging in its sufferers. The exact mechanism by which the associated biochemical changes give rise to the aged phenotype is not well understood. -LSB-edit-RSB- Chromosomes The cell nucleus contains the majority of the cell's genetic material, in the form of multiple linear DNA molecules organized into structures called chromosomes. During most of the cell cycle these are organized in a DNA-protein complex known as chromatin, and during cell division the chromatin can be seen to form the well defined chromosomes familiar from a karyotype. A small fraction of the cell's genes are located instead in the mitochondria. There are two types of chromatin. Euchromatin is the less compact DNA form, and contains genes that are frequently expressed by the cell. The other type, heterochromatin, is the more compact form, and contains DNA that are infrequently transcribed. This structure is further categorized into facultative heterochromatin, consisting of genes that are organized as heterochromatin only in certain cell types or at certain stages of development, and constitutive heterochromatin that consists of chromosome structural components such as telomeres and centromeres. During interphase the chromatin organizes itself into discrete individual patches, called chromosome territories. Active genes, which are generally found in the euchromatic region of the chromosome, tend to be located towards the chromosome's territory boundary. Antibodies to certain types of chromatin organization, particularly nucleosomes, have been associated with a number of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. These are known as anti-nuclear antibodies -LRB-ANA-RRB- and have also been observed in concert with multiple sclerosis as part of general immune system dysfunction. As in the case of progeria, the role played by the antibodies in inducing the symptoms of autoimmune diseases is not obvious. -LSB-edit-RSB- Nucleolus The nucleolus is a discrete densely stained structure found in the nucleus. It is not surrounded by a membrane, and is sometimes called a suborganelle. It forms around tandem repeats of rDNA, DNA coding for ribosomal RNA -LRB-rRNA-RRB-. These regions are called nucleolar organizer regions -LRB-NOR-RRB-. The main roles of the nucleolus are to synthesize rRNA and assemble ribosomes. The structural cohesion of the nucleolus depends on its activity, as ribosomal assembly in the nucleolus results in the transient association of nucleolar components, facilitating further ribosomal assembly, and hence further association. This model is supported by observations that inactivation of rDNA results in intermingling of nucleolar structures. The first step in ribosomal assembly is transcription of the rDNA, by a protein called RNA polymerase I, forming a large pre-rRNA precursor. This is cleaved into the subunits 5.8S, 18S, and 28S rRNA. The transcription, post-transcriptional processing, and assembly of rRNA occurs in the nucleolus, aided by small nucleolar RNA -LRB-snoRNA-RRB- molecules, some of which are derived from spliced introns from messenger RNAs encoding genes related to ribosomal function. The assembled ribosomal subunits are the largest structures passed through the nuclear pores. When observed under the electron microscope, the nucleolus can be seen to consist of three distinguishable regions: the innermost fibrillar centers -LRB-FCs-RRB-, surrounded by the dense fibrillar component -LRB-DFC-RRB-, which in turn is bordered by the granular component -LRB-GC-RRB-. Transcription of the rDNA occurs either in the FC or at the FC-DFC boundary, and therefore when rDNA transcription in the cell is increased more FCs are detected. Most of the cleavage and modification of rRNAs occurs in the DFC, while the latter steps involving protein assembly onto the ribosomal subunits occurs in the GC. -LSB-edit-RSB- Other subnuclear bodies Besides the nucleolus, the nucleus contains a number of other non-membrane delineated bodies. These include Cajal bodies, Gemini of coiled bodies, polymorphic interphase karyosomal association -LRB-PIKA-RRB-, promyelocytic leukaemia -LRB-PML-RRB- bodies, paraspeckles and splicing speckles. Although little is known about a number of these domains, they are significant in that they show that the nucleoplasm is not uniform mixture, but rather contains organized functional subdomains. Other subnuclear structures appear as part of abnormal disease processes. For example, the presence of small intranuclear rods have been reported in some cases of nemaline myopathy. This condition typically results from mutations in actin, and the rods themselves consist of mutant actin as well as other cytoskeletal proteins. -LSB-edit-RSB- Cajal bodies and gems A nucleus typically contains between 1 and 10 compact structures called Cajal bodies or coiled bodies -LRB-CB-RRB-, whose diameter measures between 0.2�µm and 2.0�µm depending on the cell type and species. When seen under an electron microscope, they resemble balls of tangled thread and are dense foci of distribution for the protein coilin. CBs are involved in a number of different roles relating to RNA processing, specifically small nucleolar RNA -LRB-snoRNA-RRB- and small nuclear RNA -LRB-snRNA-RRB- maturation, and histone mRNA modification. Similar to Cajal bodies are Gemini of coiled bodies, or gems, whose name is derived from the Gemini constellation in reference to their close ``twin'' relationship with CBs. Gems are similar in size and shape to CBs, and in fact are virtually indistinguishable under the microscope. Unlike CBs, gems do not contain small nuclear ribonucleoproteins -LRB-snRNPs-RRB-, but do contain a protein called survivor of motor neurons -LRB-SMN-RRB- whose function relates to snRNP biogenesis. Gems are believed to assist CBs in snRNP biogenesis, though it has also been suggested from microscopy evidence that CBs and gems are different manifestations of the same structure. -LSB-edit-RSB- PIKA and PTF domains PIKA domains, or polymorphic interphase karyosomal associations, were first described in microscopy studies in 1991. Their function was and remains unclear, though they were not thought to be associated with active DNA replication, transcription, or RNA processing. They have been found to often associate with discrete domains defined by dense localization of the transcription factor PTF, which promotes transcription of snRNA. -LSB-edit-RSB- PML bodies Promyelocytic leukaemia bodies -LRB-PML bodies-RRB- are spherical bodies found scattered throughout the nucleoplasm, measuring around 0.2--1.0�µm. They are known by a number of other names, including nuclear domain 10 -LRB-ND10-RRB-, Kremer bodies, and PML oncogenic domains. They are often seen in the nucleus in association with Cajal bodies and cleavage bodies. It has been suggested that they play a role in regulating transcription. -LSB-edit-RSB- Paraspeckles Discovered by Fox et al. in 2002, paraspeckles are irregularly shaped compartments in the nucleus' interchromatin space. First documented in HeLa cells, where there are generally 10--30 per nucleus, paraspeckles are now known to also exist in all human primary cells, transformed cell lines and tissue sections. Their name is derived from their distribution in the nucleus; the ``para'' is short for parallel and the ``speckles'' refers to the splicing speckles to which they are always in close proximity. Paraspeckles are dynamic structures that are altered in response to changes in cellular metabolic activity. They are transcription dependent and in the absence of RNA Pol II transcription, the paraspeckle disappears and all of its associated protein components -LRB-PSP1, p54nrb, PSP2, CFI-LRB-m-RRB-68 and PSF-RRB- form a crescent shaped perinucleolar cap in the nucleolus. This phenomenon is demonstrated during the cell cycle. In the cell cycle, paraspeckles are present during interphase and during all of mitosis except for telophase. During telophase, when the two daughter nuclei are formed, there is no RNA Pol II transcription so the protein components instead form a perinucleolar cap. -LSB-edit-RSB- Splicing speckles Sometimes referred to as interchromatin granule clusters or as splicing-factor compartments, speckles are rich in splicing snRNPs and other splicing proteins necessary for pre-mRNA processing. Because of a cell's changing requirements, the composition and location of these bodies changes according to mRNA transcription and regulation via phosphorylation of specific proteins. -LSB-edit-RSB- Function The main function of the cell nucleus is to control gene expression and mediate the replication of DNA during the cell cycle. The nucleus provides a site for genetic transcription that is segregated from the location of translation in the cytoplasm, allowing levels of gene regulation that are not available to prokaryotes. -LSB-edit-RSB- Cell compartmentalization The nuclear envelope allows the nucleus to control its contents, and separate them from the rest of the cytoplasm where necessary. This is important for controlling processes on either side of the nuclear membrane. In some cases where a cytoplasmic process needs to be restricted, a key participant is removed to the nucleus, where it interacts with transcription factors to downregulate the production of certain enzymes in the pathway. This regulatory mechanism occurs in the case of glycolysis, a cellular pathway for breaking down glucose to produce energy. Hexokinase is an enzyme responsible for the first the step of glycolysis, forming glucose-6-phosphate from glucose. At high concentrations of fructose-6-phosphate, a molecule made later from glucose-6-phosphate, a regulator protein removes hexokinase to the nucleus, where it forms a transcriptional repressor complex with nuclear proteins to reduce the expression of genes involved in glycolysis. In order to control which genes are being transcribed, the cell separates some transcription factor proteins responsible for regulating gene expression from physical access to the DNA until they are activated by other signaling pathways. This prevents even low levels of inappropriate gene expression. For example in the case of NF-κB-controlled genes, which are involved in most inflammatory responses, transcription is induced in response to a signal pathway such as that initiated by the signaling molecule TNF-α, binds to a cell membrane receptor, resulting in the recruitment of signalling proteins, and eventually activating the transcription factor NF-κB. A nuclear localisation signal on the NF-κB protein allows it to be transported through the nuclear pore and into the nucleus, where it stimulates the transcription of the target genes. The compartmentalization allows the cell to prevent translation of unspliced mRNA. Eukaryotic mRNA contains introns that must be removed before being translated to produce functional proteins. The splicing is done inside the nucleus before the mRNA can be accessed by ribosomes for translation. Without the nucleus ribosomes would translate newly transcribed -LRB-unprocessed-RRB- mRNA resulting in misformed and nonfunctional proteins. -LSB-edit-RSB- Gene expression Gene expression first involves transcription, in which DNA is used as a template to produce RNA. In the case of genes encoding proteins, that RNA produced from this process is messenger RNA -LRB-mRNA-RRB-, which then needs to be translated by ribosomes to form a protein. As ribosomes are located outside the nucleus, mRNA produced needs to be exported. Since the nucleus is the site of transcription, it also contains a variety of proteins which either directly mediate transcription or are involved in regulating the process. These proteins include helicases that unwind the double-stranded DNA molecule to facilitate access to it, RNA polymerases that synthesize the growing RNA molecule, topoisomerases that change the amount of supercoiling in DNA, helping it wind and unwind, as well as a large variety of transcription factors that regulate expression. -LSB-edit-RSB- Processing of pre-mRNA Newly synthesized mRNA molecules are known as primary transcripts or pre-mRNA. They must undergo post-transcriptional modification in the nucleus before being exported to the cytoplasm; mRNA that appears in the nucleus without these modifications is degraded rather than used for protein translation. The three main modifications are 5' capping, 3' polyadenylation, and RNA splicing. While in the nucleus, pre-mRNA is associated with a variety of proteins in complexes known as heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particles -LRB-hnRNPs-RRB-. Addition of the 5' cap occurs co-transcriptionally and is the first step in post-transcriptional modification. The 3' poly-adenine tail is only added after transcription is complete. RNA splicing, carried out by a complex called the spliceosome, is the process by which introns, or regions of DNA that do not code for protein, are removed from the pre-mRNA and the remaining exons connected to re-form a single continuous molecule. This process normally occurs after 5' capping and 3' polyadenylation but can begin before synthesis is complete in transcripts with many exons. Many pre-mRNAs, including those encoding antibodies, can be spliced in multiple ways to produce different mature mRNAs that encode different protein sequences. This process is known as alternative splicing, and allows production of a large variety of proteins from a limited amount of DNA. -LSB-edit-RSB- Dynamics and regulation -LSB-edit-RSB- Nuclear transport The entry and exit of large molecules from the nucleus is tightly controlled by the nuclear pore complexes. Although small molecules can enter the nucleus without regulation, macromolecules such as RNA and proteins require association karyopherins called importins to enter the nucleus and exportins to exit. ``Cargo'' proteins that must be translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus contain short amino acid sequences known as nuclear localization signals which are bound by importins, while those transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm carry nuclear export signals bound by exportins. The ability of importins and exportins to transport their cargo is regulated by GTPases, enzymes that hydrolyze the molecule guanosine triphosphate to release energy. The key GTPase in nuclear transport is Ran, which can bind either GTP or GDP -LRB-guanosine diphosphate-RRB- depending on whether it is located in the nucleus or the cytoplasm. Whereas importins depend on RanGTP to dissociate from their cargo, exportins require RanGTP in order to bind to their cargo. Nuclear import depends on the importin binding its cargo in the cytoplasm and carrying it through the nuclear pore into the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, RanGTP acts to separate the cargo from the importin, allowing the importin to exit the nucleus and be reused. Nuclear export is similar, as the exportin binds the cargo inside the nucleus in a process facilitated by RanGTP, exits through the nuclear pore, and separates from its cargo in the cytoplasm. Specialized export proteins exist for translocation of mature mRNA and tRNA to the cytoplasm after post-transcriptional modification is complete. This quality-control mechanism is important due to the these molecules' central role in protein translation; mis-expression of a protein due to incomplete excision of exons or mis-incorporation of amino acids could have negative consequences for the cell; thus incompletely modified RNA that reaches the cytoplasm is degraded rather than used in translation. -LSB-edit-RSB- Assembly and disassembly During its lifetime a nucleus may be broken down, either in the process of cell division or as a consequence of apoptosis, a regulated form of cell death. During these events, the structural components of the nucleus--the envelope and lamina--are systematically degraded. During the cell cycle the cell divides to form two cells. In order for this process to be possible, each of the new daughter cells must have a full set of genes, a process requiring replication of the chromosomes as well as segregation of the separate sets. This occurs by the replicated chromosomes, the sister chromatids, attaching to microtubules, which in turn are attached to different centrosomes. The sister chromatids can then be pulled to separate locations in the cell. In many cells the centrosome is located in the cytoplasm, outside the nucleus, the microtubules would be unable to attach to the chromatids in the presence of the nuclear envelope. Therefore the early stages in the cell cycle, beginning in prophase and until around prometaphase, the nuclear membrane is dismantled. Likewise, during the same period, the nuclear lamina is also disassembled, a process regulated by phosphorylation of the lamins. Towards the end of the cell cycle, the nuclear membrane is reformed, and around the same time, the nuclear lamina are reassembled by dephosphorylating the lamins. However, in dinoflagellates the nuclear envelope remains intact, the centrosomes are located in the cytoplasm, and the microtubules come in contact with chromosomes, whose centromeric regions are incorporated into the nuclear envelope -LRB-the so-called closed mitosis with extranuclear spindle-RRB-. In many other protists -LRB-e.g. ciliates, sporozoans-RRB- and fungi the centrosomes are intranuclear, and their nuclear envelope also does not disassemle during cell division. Apoptosis is a controlled process in which the cell's structural components are destroyed, resulting in death of the cell. Changes associated with apoptosis directly affect the nucleus and its contents, for example in the condensation of chromatin and the disintegration of the nuclear envelope and lamina. The destruction of the lamin networks is controlled by specialized apoptotic proteases called caspases, which cleave the lamin proteins and thus degrade the nucleus' structural integrity. Lamin cleavage is sometimes used as a laboratory indicator of caspase activity in assays for early apoptotic activity. Cells that express mutant caspase-resistant lamins are deficient in nuclear changes related to apoptosis, suggesting that lamins play a role in initiating the events that lead to apoptotic degradation of the nucleus. Inhibition of lamin assembly itself is an inducer of apoptosis. The nuclear envelope acts as a barrier that prevents both DNA and RNA viruses from entering the nucleus. Some viruses require access to proteins inside the nucleus in order to replicate and/or assemble. DNA viruses, such as herpesvirus replicate and assemble in the cell nucleus, and exit by budding through the inner nuclear membrane. This process is accompanied by disassembly of the lamina on the nuclear face of the inner membrane. -LSB-edit-RSB- Anucleated and polynucleated cells Although most cells have a single nucleus, some eukaryotic cell types have no nucleus, and others have many nuclei. This can be a normal process, as in the maturation of mammalian red blood cells, or a result of faulty cell division. Anucleated cells contain no nucleus and are therefore incapable of dividing to produce daughter cells. The best-known anucleated cell is the mammalian red blood cell, or erythrocyte, which also lacks other organelles such as mitochondria and serves primarily as a transport vessel to ferry oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues. Erythrocytes mature through erythropoiesis in the bone marrow, where they lose their nuclei, organelles, and ribosomes. The nucleus is expelled during the process of differentiation from an erythroblast to a reticulocyte, which is the immediate precursor of the mature erythrocyte. The presence of mutagens may induce the release of some immature ``micronucleated'' erythrocytes into the bloodstream. Anucleated cells can also arise from flawed cell division in which one daughter lacks a nucleus and the other has two nuclei. Polynucleated cells contain multiple nuclei. Most Acantharean species of protozoa and some fungi in mycorrhizae have naturally polynucleated cells. Other examples include the intestinal parasites in the genus Giardia, which have two nuclei per cell. In humans, skeletal muscle cells, called myocytes, become polynucleated during development; the resulting arrangement of nuclei near the periphery of the cells allows maximal intracellular space for myofibrils. Multinucleated cells can also be abnormal in humans; for example, cells arising from the fusion of monocytes and macrophages, known as giant multinucleated cells, sometimes accompany inflammation and are also implicated in tumor formation. -LSB-edit-RSB- Evolution As the major defining characteristic of the eukaryotic cell, the nucleus' evolutionary origin has been the subject of much speculation. Four major theories have been proposed to explain the existence of the nucleus, although none have yet earned widespread support. The theory known as the ``syntrophic model'' proposes that a symbiotic relationship between the archaea and bacteria created the nucleus-containing eukaryotic cell. It is hypothesized that the symbiosis originated when ancient archaea, similar to modern methanogenic archaea, invaded and lived within bacteria similar to modern myxobacteria, eventually forming the early nucleus. This theory is analogous to the accepted theory for the origin of eukaryotic mitochondria and chloroplasts, which are thought to have developed from a similar endosymbiotic relationship between proto-eukaryotes and aerobic bacteria. The archaeal origin of the nucleus is supported by observations that archaea and eukarya have similar genes for certain proteins, including histones. Observations that myxobacteria are motile, can form multicellular complexes, and possess kinases and G proteins similar to eukarya, support a bacterial origin for the eukaryotic cell. A second model proposes that proto-eukaryotic cells evolved from bacteria without an endosymbiotic stage. This model is based on the existence of modern planctomycetes bacteria that possess a nuclear structure with primitive pores and other compartmentalized membrane structures. A similar proposal states that a eukaryote-like cell, the chronocyte, evolved first and phagocytosed archaea and bacteria to generate the nucleus and the eukaryotic cell. The most controversial model, known as viral eukaryogenesis, posits that the membrane-bound nucleus, along with other eukaryotic features, originated from the infection of a prokaryote by a virus. The suggestion is based on similarities between eukaryotes and viruses such as linear DNA strands, mRNA capping, and tight binding to proteins -LRB-analogizing histones to viral envelopes-RRB-. One version of the proposal suggests that the nucleus evolved in concert with phagocytosis to form an early cellular ``predator''. Another variant proposes that eukaryotes originated from early archaea infected by poxviruses, on the basis of observed similarity between the DNA polymerases in modern poxviruses and eukaryotes. It has been suggested that the unresolved question of the evolution of sex could be related to the viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis. Finally, a very recent proposal suggests that traditional variants of the endosymbiont theory are insufficiently powerful to explain the origin of the eukaryotic nucleus. This model, termed the exomembrane hypothesis, suggests that the nucleus instead originated from a single ancestral cell that evolved a second exterior cell membrane; the interior membrane enclosing the original cell then became the nuclear membrane and evolved increasingly elaborate pore structures for passage of internally synthesized cellular components such as ribosomal subunits. This model is based on the existence of modern planctomycetes bacteria that possess a nuclear structure with primitive pores and other compartmentalized membrane structures. In order to control which genes are being transcribed, the cell separates some transcription factor proteins responsible for regulating gene expression from physical access to the DNA until they are activated by other signaling pathways. -LSB-edit-RSB- Chromosomes The cell nucleus contains the majority of the cell's genetic material, in the form of multiple linear DNA molecules organized into structures called chromosomes.

One example was the Sugar Act, which was a tax levied against Providence's distilleries that adversely affected its trade in rum and slaves. These taxes caused Providence to join the other colonies in renouncing allegiance to the British Crown. In response to enforcement of unpopular trade laws, Providence residents spilled the first blood of the American Revolution in the notorious Gaspée Affair of 1772. Though during the Revolutionary War the city escaped enemy occupation, the capture of nearby Newport disrupted industry and kept the population on alert. Troops were quartered for various campaigns and Brown University's University Hall was used as a barracks and military hospital. After departing from Newport, French troops sent by King Louis XVI and commanded by the Comte de Rochambeau passed through Providence on their way to join the attack against British forces. The march from Newport to Providence was the beginning of a campaign led jointly by General George Washington in a decisive march that ended with the defeat of General Cornwallis in the Siege of Yorktown at Yorktown, Virginia and the Battle of the Chesapeake. Following the war, the economy shifted from maritime endeavors to manufacturing, particularly machinery, tools, silverware, jewelry and textiles. At one time, Providence boasted some of the largest manufacturing plants in the country, including Brown & Sharpe, Nicholson File, and Gorham Silverware, and with 7,614 people, was the country's ninth-largest city.b-LSB-'-RSB- The city's industries attracted many immigrants from Ireland, Germany, Sweden, England, Italy, Portugal, Cape Verde, and French Canada. Economic and demographic shifts caused social strife, notably with a series of race riots between whites and blacks during the 1820s. In response to these troubles and the economic growth, Providence residents ratified a city charter in 1831 as the population passed 17,000. During the Civil War, local politics split over slavery as many had ties to Southern cotton. Despite ambivalence concerning the war, the number of military volunteers routinely exceeded quota, and the city's manufacturing proved invaluable to the Union. Postwar, horsecar lines covering the city enabled its growth and Providence thrived with waves of immigrants and land annexations bringing the population from 54,595 in 1865 to 175,597 by 1900. The city's boom began to wane in the mid-1920s as industries, notably textiles, shut down. Jewelry manufacturing continued to grow, taking up the slack and employing many of the city's new immigrants, coming from Portuguese, Italian, Polish, Lithuanian and Jewish backgrounds. A number of hospitals also opened. The Great Depression hit the city hard, and Providence's downtown was subsequently flooded by the New England Hurricane of 1938. Though the city received a boost from World War II, this ended with the war. The city saw further decline as a result of nation-wide trends, with the construction of highways and increased suburbanization. The population would drop by 38% over the next three decades. From the 1950s to the 1980s, Providence was a notorious bastion of organized crime. The mafia boss Raymond L.S. Patriarca ruled a vast criminal enterprise. The city's eponymous ``Renaissance'' began in the 1970s. From 1975 until 1982, $606 million of local and national Community Development funds were invested throughout the city, and the hitherto falling population began to stabilize. In the 1990s, Mayor Vincent Cianci, Jr showcased the city's strength in arts and pushed for further revitalization, ultimately resulting in the uncovering of the city's natural rivers -LRB-which had been paved over-RRB-, relocation of a large section of railroad underground, creation of Waterplace Park and river walks along the river's banks, and construction of the Fleet Skating Rink -LRB-now the Bank of America Skating Rink-RRB- downtown and the 1.4 million ft² Providence Place Mall. New investment triggered within the city, with new construction including numerous condo projects, hotels, and a new office high-rise all filling in the freed space. Despite new investment, poverty remains an entrenched problem as it does in most post-industrial New England cities. Nearly 30 percent of the city population lives below the poverty line. Recent increases in real estate values further exacerbate problems for those at marginal income levels, as Providence had the highest rise in median housing price of any city in the United States from 2004 to 2005. -LSB-edit-RSB- Geography The Providence city limits enclose a small geographic region, with a total area of 20.5�square miles -LRB-53.2�km²-RRB-. 18.5�square miles -LRB-47.8�km²-RRB- of it is land and the remaining 2.1�square miles -LRB-5.3�km²-RRB- -LRB-roughly 10%-RRB- of it is water. Providence is located at the head of Narragansett Bay, with the Providence River running into the bay through the center of the city, formed by the confluence of the Moshassuck and Woonasquatucket Rivers. The Waterplace Park amphitheater and riverwalks line the river's banks through downtown. Constitution Hill -LRB-near downtown-RRB-, College -LRB-or Prospect-RRB- Hill -LRB-east of the Providence River-RRB-, and Federal Hill -LRB-west of downtown and is New England's largest Italian district-RRB- are the most prominent of the city's hills. The remaining hills include Tockwotten Hill at Fox Point, Smith Hill -LRB-where the State House is located-RRB-, Christian Hill at Hoyle Square -LRB-junction of Cranston & Westminster Streets-RRB-, and Weybosset Hill at the lower end of Weybosset Street, which was leveled in the early 1880s. -LSB-edit-RSB- Neighborhoods Providence has 25 official neighborhoods, though these neighborhoods are often grouped together and referred to collectively:  -LSB-edit-RSB- Cityscape The city of Providence is geographically very compact, characteristic of eastern seaboard cities which developed prior to use of the automobile. It is among the most densely populated cities in the country. For this reason, Providence has the eighth-highest percentage of pedestrian commuters. The street layout is somewhat chaotic--over one thousand streets -LRB-a great number for the city's size-RRB- run haphazardly, connecting and radiating from traditionally bustling places like Market Square. Downtown Providence has numerous 19th century mercantile buildings in the Federal and Victorian architectural styles, as well as several post-modern and modernist buildings, are located throughout this area. In particular, a fairly clear spatial separation appears between the areas of pre-1980s development and post-1980s development. West Exchange Street and Exchange Terrace serve as rough boundaries between the two. The newer area, sometimes called ``Capitol Center'', includes Providence Place Mall -LRB-1999-RRB-, a Westin hotel -LRB-1993-RRB- and The Residences at the Westin -LRB-2007-RRB-, GTECH -LRB-2006-RRB-, Waterplace condominiums -LRB-2007-RRB-, and Waterplace Park -LRB-1994-RRB-; the area tends toward newer development since much of it is land reclaimed in the 1970s from a mass of railroad tracks which was referred to colloquially as the ``Chinese Wall''. This part of Downtown is characterized by open spaces, wide roads, and intent landscaping. The historic part of downtown has many streetscapes that look as they did eighty years ago. Many of the state's tallest buildings are found here. The largest structure, to date, is the art-deco-styled former Industrial Trust Tower, currently the Bank of America Building at 426 feet -LRB-130 m-RRB-. By contrast, nearby to it is the second tallest One Financial Plaza, designed in modern taut-skin cladding, constructed a half century later. In between the two is 50 Kennedy Plaza. The Textron Tower is also a core building to the modest Providence skyline. Downtown is also the home of the Providence Biltmore and Westminster Arcade, the oldest enclosed shopping mall in the U.S., built in 1828. The city's southern waterfront, away from the downtown core, is the location of many oil tanks, a docking station for a ferry boat, a decommissioned Russian submarine, a non-profit sailing center, bars, strip clubs, and power plants. The Fox Point Hurricane Barrier is also found here, built to protect Providence from storm surge, like that it had endured in the 1938 New England Hurricane and again in 1954 from Hurricane Carol. The majority of the cityscape comprises abandoned and revitalized industrial mills, double and triple decker housing -LRB-though the row houses found so commonly in other Northeast cities, are notably rare here-RRB-, a small number of high-rise buildings -LRB-predominantly for housing the elderly-RRB-, and single family homes. I-95 serves as a physical barrier between the city's commercial core and neighborhoods such as Federal Hill and the West End. -LSB-edit-RSB- Climate Providence's climate is between humid continental climate and humid subtropical climate, with warm summers, cold winters, and high humidity year-round. The USDA rates the city at Zone 6a, which is an ``in-between'' climate. The influence of the Atlantic Ocean keeps Providence, and the rest of the state of Rhode Island, warmer than many inland locales in New England. January is the coldest month with average high temperatures of 37�°F -LRB-3�°C-RRB- and average low temperatures of 20 °F -LRB--7 °C-RRB-. July is the warmest month with average high temperatures of 83 °F -LRB-28 °C-RRB- and average low temperatures of 64 °F -LRB-18 °C-RRB-. The record high temperature in the city was 104 °F -LRB-40 °C-RRB- recorded in 1975. The record low temperature in the city was -17 °F -LRB--27 °C-RRB- recorded in 1934. As with the rest of the northeastern seaboard, Providence receives ample precipitation year-round. Monthly precipitation ranges from a high of 4.43 inches -LRB-112.5�mm-RRB- in March to a low of 3.17�inches -LRB-80.5�mm-RRB- in July. Precipitation levels are generally slightly lesser in the summer months than the winter months when powerful storms known as Nor'easters can cause significant snowfall and blizzard conditions. Although hurricanes are not frequent in coastal New England, Providence's location at the head of Narragansett Bay makes it vulnerable to them. According to Forbes.com, the Providence-New Bedford-Fall River metropolitan area is ranked 30 on America's Most Toxic Cities  -LSB-edit-RSB- Demographics As of the census of 2000, the population comprised 173,618 people, 62,389 households, and 35,859 families. The population density was 3,629.4/km² -LRB-9,401.7/sq�mi-RRB-, characteristic of comparatively older cities in New England such as New Haven, Connecticut; Boston, Massachusetts and Hartford, Connecticut. Also like these cities, its population peaked in the 1940s just prior to the nationwide period of rapid suburbanization. Providence has had a substantial Italian population since the turn of the century, with 14% -LRB-a pluralityc-LSB-'-RSB--RRB- of the population claiming Italian ancestry. Italian influence manifests itself in Providence's Little Italy in Federal Hill. Irish immigrants have also had considerable influence on the city's history, with 8% of residents claiming Irish heritage. Belying Providence's traditionally white makeup is the sizable minority presence it has acquired in the last twenty years. Though nearby cities like Boston and Hartford have longer-standing black and Latino communities, Providence now surpasses both in the density of its minority population, with non-Hispanic whites comprising less than half -LRB-40.9%-RRB- of the population. Though salient contributions to this growth have been among Asians and unspecified races, the most dramatic change comes from Hispanics, whose presence has increased fivefold. Having origins in Puerto Rico, Colombia, Bolivia, the Dominican Republic, and Central America -LRB-particularly Guatemala-RRB-, Hispanics have strong influence in the neighborhoods of Elmwood, the West End, and Upper and Lower South Providence. Hispanic impact is even larger in the city's schools. Hispanics represent over half -LRB-55%-RRB- of all students in the city's school system while comprising only 36% of Providence's population. In addition, Providence, like the nearby Massachusetts cities of Fall River and New Bedford, has a considerable community of immigrants from various Portuguese-speaking countries, living mostly in the areas of Washington Park and Fox Point. Portuguese is the city's third-largest nationality, -LRB-after Italian and Irish-RRB- at 4% of the population while Cape Verdeans make up another 2%. African Americans constitute approximately 17% of the city with the largest percentages in Mount Hope and Upper and Lower South Providence neighborhoods. Asians are 6% of Providence's population and have enclaves scattered throughout the city. Another 6% of the city has multiracial ancestry. Native Americans and Pacific Islanders make up the remaining 1.3%. With Liberians comprising .4% of the population, the city is home to the one of the three largest Liberian immigrant populations in the country. The Providence metropolitan area, which includes Providence, Fall River, Massachusetts, and Warwick is estimated to be 1,622,520. In 2006, this area was officially added to the Boston Combined Statistical Area -LRB-CSA-RRB-, the fifth-largest CSA in the country. In the last fifteen years, Providence has experienced a sizable growth in its under-18 population, attributed to the influx of Hispanics. The median age of the city is 28 years, while the largest age cohort is 20 to 24 year olds, owing to the city's large student population. The per capita income, as of the 2000 census, was $15,525, which is well below both the state average of $29,113, and the national average of $21,587. The median income for a household was $26,867, and the median income for a family in Providence was $32,058, according to the 2000 census. The city has one of the highest rates of poverty in the nation with 29.1% of the population and 23.9% of families living below the poverty line in 2000, the largest concentrations being found in the city's Olneyville, and Upper and Lower South Providence areas. Poverty has affected children at a disproportionately higher rate with 40.1% of those under the age of 18 living below the poverty line, concentrated particularly west of downtown in the neighborhoods of Hartford, Federal Hill, and Olneyville. -LSB-edit-RSB- Crime Compared to the national average, Providence has a higher than average rate of property crime and an average rate of violent crime per 100,000 inhabitants. In 2009, there were 24 murders, the highest number since 2000 and a jump from the previous year's 13. Crime in all categories had been dropping substantially during 2002-2007, contrary to national trends. The nearby city of Worcester, Massachusetts which is about the same size had six murders in 2009 by comparison. The much larger city of Boston had 42. The police chief asserted that such violence was not stranger-to-stranger, but relationship driven. The pattern of violent crime was highly specific by neighborhood with vast majority of the murders taking place in the poorest sections of Providence, such as Washington Park, Elmwood, South Providence and the West End. In 2003, of the 239 United States cities with populations over 100,000, Providence's violent crime rate ranked 84th, as compared with New York City at 94th and Boston at 28th. Providence has the fifth-highest rate of property crime per 100,000 inhabitants in the country. Burglary and car theft, in particular constitute 1.12 and 2.49 times the national average. -LSB-edit-RSB- Economy Providence was one of the first cities to industrialize in the United States. By 1830, the city had manufacturing industries in metals, machinery, textiles, jewelry, and silverware. Though manufacturing has declined, the city is still one of the largest centers for jewelry and silverware design and manufacturing. Services, particularly education, health care, and finance, also make up a large portion of the city's economy. Providence also is the site of a sectional center facility, a regional hub for the U.S. Postal Service. Since it is the capital of Rhode Island, Providence's economy additionally consists of government services. The Fortune 500 conglomerate Textron and Fortune 1000 company Nortek Incorporated are both headquartered in the city, and GTECH's world headquarters has recently been moved to downtown Providence. Citizens Bank is also headquartered in Providence. Another company whose origins were in the city is Fleet Bank. Once Rhode Island's largest bank, it moved its headquarters to Boston, Massachusetts, after acquiring Shawmut Bank in 1995. Before its acquisition by Bank of America, Fleet merged with BankBoston to become New England's largest commercial bank. The city is home to the Rhode Island Convention Center, which opened in December 1993. Along with a hotel, the convention center is connected to the Providence Place Mall, a major retail center, through a skywalk. The Port of Providence, the second largest deepwater seaport in New England, handles cargo such as cement, chemicals, heavy machinery, petroleum, and scrap metal. -LSB-edit-RSB- Government Providence serves as Rhode Island's capital, housing the Rhode Island General Assembly as well as the offices of the Governor and the Lieutenant Governor in the Rhode Island State House. Providence's city government has a mayor-council form of government. The Providence City Council consists of fifteen city councilors, one for each of the city's wards. The council is tasked with enacting ordinances and passing an annual budget. Providence also has probate and superior courts. The U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island is located downtown across from City Hall adjacent to Kennedy Plaza. David N. Cicilline was elected mayor by a large margin in 2002 and was re-elected without any major opposition in 2006. Cicilline is the first and only openly gay mayor of an American state capital. Providence was the largest American city to have an openly gay mayor, until Sam Adams took office in Portland, Oregon on January 1, 2009. -LSB-edit-RSB- Education -LSB-edit-RSB- Postsecondary Seven of the fourteen institutions of higher learning in Rhode Island have campuses in Providence -LRB-city proper-RRB-: Between these schools the number of postsecondary students is approximately 44,000, or 25% the population of Providence. Compounded by Brown University's being the second-largest employer, higher education exerts a considerable presence in the city's politics and economy. -LSB-edit-RSB- Private and charter schools Several private schools, including Moses Brown, the Lincoln School, and the Wheeler School, are in the city's East Side. LaSalle Academy is located in the Elmhurst area of the city near Providence College. The public charter schools Time Squared Academy -LRB-K-12-RRB- and Textron Chamber of Commerce -LRB-9-12-RRB- are funded by GTECH and Textron respectively. In addition, the city's South Side houses Community Preparatory School, a private school serving primarily low-income students in grades 3-8. Within the semi-private schools, The Metropolitan Regional Career and Technical Center -LRB-The Met-RRB- and The Big Picture Company schools serve students through real world experiences and project-based learning. There are two separate centers for students with special needs. -LSB-edit-RSB- Public schools The Providence Public School District serves about 26,000 students from pre-Kindergarten to grade 12. The district has 25 elementary schools, nine middle schools, and thirteen high schools. The Providence Public School District features magnet schools at the middle and high school level, Nathanael Greene and Classical respectively. The overall graduation rate as of 2007 is 70.1%, which is close to the statewide rate of 71% and the national average of 70%. -LSB-edit-RSB- Culture Much of Providence culture is synonymous with Rhode Island culture. Like the state, the city has a non-rhotic accent which can be heard on local media. Providence also shares Rhode Island's affinity for coffee, as the former has the most coffee/doughnut shops per capita of any city in the country. Providence is also reputed to have the highest number of restaurants per capita, many of which are founded and/or staffed by its own Johnson & Wales graduates. Providence has several ethnic neighborhoods, notably Federal Hill and the North End -LRB-Italian-RRB-, Fox Point -LRB-Cape Verdean and Portuguese-RRB-, West End -LRB-mainly Central American and Asians-RRB-, and Smith Hill -LRB-Irish with miscellaneous enclaves of other groups-RRB-. There are also many dedicated community organizations and arts associations located in the city. The city gained the reputation as one of the most active and growing LGBT communities in the Northeast; the rate of reported gay and lesbian relationships is 75% higher than the national average and Providence has been named among the ``Best Lesbian Places to Live''. The current mayor, David Cicilline, won his election running as an openly gay man, making him the first openly gay mayor of a U.S. state capital. Former Mayor Cianci instituted the position of Mayor's Liaison to the Gay and Lesbian community in the 1990s. There are numerous social and community organizations supporting the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender community. Providence is home to the largest gay bathhouse in New England. During the summer months, the city regularly hosts WaterFire, an environmental art installation that consists of about 100 bonfires that blaze just above the surface of the three rivers that pass through the middle of downtown Providence. There are multiple Waterfire events that are accompanied by various pieces of classical and world music. The public art displays, most notably sculptures, change on a regular basis. The city is also the home of the Tony Award-winning theater group Trinity Repertory Company, the Providence Black Repertory Company, and the Rhode Island Philharmonic Orchestra. Providence is also the home of several performing arts centers such as the Veterans Memorial Auditorium, the Providence Performing Arts Center, and the Providence Festival Ballet. The city's underground music scene, centered around artist-run spaces such as the now-defunct Fort Thunder, is known in underground music circles. -LSB-edit-RSB- Sites of interest Providence is home to an 1,200-acre -LRB-4.9�km2-RRB- park system, notably Waterplace Park and Riverwalk, Roger Williams Park, Roger Williams National Memorial, and Prospect Terrace Park, the latter featuring expansive views of the downtown area. As one of the first cities in the country, Providence contains many historic buildings while the East Side neighborhood in particular includes the largest contiguous area of buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places in the U.S. with many pre-revolutionary houses. The East Side is also home to the First Baptist Church in America, the oldest Baptist church in the Americas, founded by Roger Williams in 1638, as well as the Old State House, which served as the state's capitol from 1762 to 1904. Nearby is Roger Williams National Memorial. Downcity Providence is home to the fourth largest unsupported dome in the world -LRB-the second largest marble dome after St. Peter's Basilica in Rome-RRB-, as well as the Westminster Arcade, which is the oldest enclosed shopping center in the U.S.. The main art museum is the Rhode Island School of Design Museum, which has the twentieth largest collection in the country. The city's southern waterfront hosts a decommissioned Cold War era Russian submarine. In addition to the Providence Public Library and its nine branches, the city is home to the Providence Athenæum, the fourth oldest library in the country. Here, on one of his many visits to Providence, Edgar Allan Poe, met and courted a love interest named Sarah Helen Whitman. Poe was a regular fixture there, as was H. P. Lovecraft; both of them influential writers of gothic literature.

The city is also where Rocky Marciano won 29 of his 49 fights. The city's defunct baseball team, the Providence Grays, competed in the National League from 1879 through 1885. The team defeated the New York Metropolitans in baseball's first successful ``world championship series'' in 1884. In 1914, after the Boston Red Sox purchased Babe Ruth from the then-minor league Baltimore Orioles, the team prepared Ruth for the major leagues by sending him to finish the season playing for a minor league team in Providence that was also known as the Grays. Today, professional baseball is offered by the Pawtucket Red Sox, the AAA affiliate of the Boston Red Sox which plays in nearby Pawtucket. Most baseball fans--along with the local media--tend to follow the Boston Red Sox. Major colleges and universities fielding NCAA Division I athletic teams are Brown University and Providence College. The latter is a member of the Big East Conference. Much local hype is associated with games between these two schools or the University of Rhode Island. Providence has also hosted the alternative sports event Gravity Games from 1999 to 2001, and was also the first host of ESPN's X Games, known in its first edition as the Extreme Games, in 1995. -LSB-edit-RSB- Infrastructure -LSB-edit-RSB- Health and medicine Providence is home to eight hospitals, most prominently Rhode Island Hospital, the largest general acute care hospital in the state.

After the stills finish, we hear Raucher speaking in the present day -LRB-1971 according to the book-RRB-, recalling the summer he spent on the island -LRB-fictionalized in the novel as ``Packett Island''-RRB- in 1942. The film flashes back to a day that then 15-year-old ``Hermie'' -LRB-Gary Grimes-RRB- and his friends�-- jock Oscy -LRB-Jerry Houser-RRB- and introverted nerd Benjie -LRB-Oliver Conant-RRB-�-- spent running and playing on the beach. In the middle of their goofing off, the three boys spot a newlywed young soldier carrying his bride -LRB-Jennifer O'Neill-RRB- into a house on the beach. The boys are all struck by her beauty, especially Hermie, who finds himself unable to get her out of his mind. The next several days on the island find the boys continuing to spend their afternoons on the beach, where, in the midst of young, scantily-clad teenage girls, their thoughts invariably turn to sex; all of them are virgins, the height of their experience being when Oscy and Hermie touched a girl's breasts when they were twelve. While Oscy is more interested in sex with gorgeous girls, however, Hermie finds himself developing genuine romantic interest in the young bride, whose husband he spots leaving the island on a military transport boat one morning. Later that day, Hermie spots her trying to carry numerous bags of groceries by herself, and helps her get them back to her house. The two strike up a friendship and he agrees to return in the future to help her out with chores. Meanwhile, Benjie mentions that one of the books kept in the beach house his parents are renting is a sex manual. Oscy and Hermie convince the reluctant Benjie to steal the book; upon reading it, Oscy and Hermie become convinced they now know everything necessary to lose their virginity and become great lovers. They decide to put this hypothesis to the test by going to the island film house and picking up a trio of girls; Oscy happens to find three high-school girls, and sets about staking out the most attractive one, Miriam -LRB-Christopher Norris-RRB-, for himself, ``giving'' Hermie her wallflower friend, Aggie -LRB-Katherine Allentuck-RRB- and leaving Benjie with Gloria, a heavyset girl with braces. Frightened by the reality of the concept of sex, Benjie runs away into the night, and is not seen by Hermie or Oscy again the whole summer. Gloria, thinking that her appearance repulsed Benjie, likewise walks away. Hermie and Oscy spend the entirety of the film -LRB-Now, Voyager - an anachronism, as that film wasn't released until October 1942-RRB- attempting to ``score'' with Miriam and Aggie, Oscy aggressively pursuing Miriam to the point that she strikes him, although Oscy soon learns that she is the island ``hussy'' and simply playing hard to get. Hermie, meanwhile, finds himself getting unexpected success with Aggie, who allows him to grope her breast for almost twelve minutes; it isn't until after the show Oscy points out to Hermie the reason for Aggie's passivity was that Hermie was in fact fondling her elbow. The following morning, Hermie helps the young bride move boxes into her attic, and when he turns down her offer of monetary compensation, she thanks him for his honesty and friendship and gives him a kiss on the forehead. Later, in preparation for a marshmallow roast on the beach with Aggie and Miriam, Hermie and Oscy make carbon copies from the sex manual; then Hermie goes to the local drugstore, and in a protracted sequence attempts to build up the nerve to ask the pharmacist for condoms. He eventually does so, after purchasing some ice cream, telling the pharmacist that the condoms are for his ``brother'' and he thinks that they are, in fact, a type of water balloon. That night, during the marshmallow roast, Hermie finds himself unable to ``put the moves'' on Aggie, although Oscy is successful in having sex with Miriam between some sand dunes; he is so successful, in fact, he eventually sneaks over to where Hermie and Aggie are roasting marshmallows and asks Hermie to give him some condoms, having run out of his own. Confused as to what's happening, Aggie follows Oscy back between the dunes, where she sees him having sex with Miriam and runs home crying. Hermie, too, sees the act, although he is more mesmerized than anything. The next day, Hermie comes across the young bride sitting outside her house, writing a letter to her husband. Hermie offers to come keep her company that night and she says she looks forward to seeing him, finally revealing that her name is Dorothy. An elated Hermie goes home and puts on a suit, saddle shoes, and a dress shirt, and heads back to Dorothy's house, running into Oscy on the way; Oscy relates Miriam's appendix burst that morning and she's been rushed to the mainland. Hermie, now convinced he is at the brink of adulthood because of his relationship with Dorothy, brushes Oscy off and the two get into a fight. Oscy threatens to tell everyone on the island that Hermie is a homosexual, and storms off. Hermie heads over to Dorothy's house, which he finds eerily quiet. Sneaking in, he discovers an empty bottle of whiskey, several cigarette butts, and a telegram from the U.S. Government, with a time stamp of just an hour prior, saying that Dorothy's husband is dead, his plane having been shot down over France. Dorothy comes out of her bedroom, crying, and Hermie comforts her. She moves to the record player and turns on an album and invites Hermie to dance with her. Near the end of the song, Dorothy kisses Hermie and the two embrace, slowly moving to the bedroom, where she makes love with him. Afterwards, Dorothy puts on her bathrobe and retires to the porch while Hermie dresses alone in her bedroom. He approaches her on the porch, where she can only say ``good night'' to him. Hermie leaves, his last image of Dorothy being that of her leaning against the railing, as she smokes a cigarette and stares off into the night sky. Hermie spends the entire night roaming the island in a state of shock. At dawn he meets Oscy and the two share a silent moment of reconciliation, broken only by Oscy's informing Hermie that Miriam survived her appendix bursting but will remain hospitalized until autumn. Sensing that something traumatic has occurred between Hermie and Dorothy, Oscy, in an uncharacteristic act of sensitivity, lets Hermie be by himself, departing with the words, ``Sometimes life is just one big pain in the ass.'' Hermie goes back to Dorothy's house to try to sort out what has happened; he finds it abandoned, Dorothy having fled the island in the night. All that remains is an envelope tacked to her front door with Hermie's name on it. Hermie opens it; inside is a note from Dorothy, saying that she hopes he understands that she must go back home to arrange her husband's funeral and deal with familial obligations. She assures Hermie that she will never forget him, and that she hopes one day he will come to terms with what happened that night. Her note closes with the hope that Hermie may be spared the senseless tragedies of life. In the film's final scene, Hermie is seen looking at Dorothy's old house and the ocean and remembering the day that he, Oscy, and Benjie first saw her, as the adult Herman Raucher sadly recounts that in the ensuing years he has never seen Dorothy again or learned what became of her. -LSB-edit-RSB- Factual basis The film -LRB-and subsequent novel-RRB- were memoirs written by Herman Raucher; they detailed the events in his life over the course of the summer he spent on Nantucket Island in 1942 when he was fourteen years old. Originally, the film was meant to be a tribute to his friend Oscar ``Oscy'' Seltzer, an Army medic killed in the Korean War. Seltzer was shot dead on a battlefield in Korea whilst attending to a wounded man; this happened on Raucher's birthday, and consequently, Raucher has not celebrated a birthday since. During the course of writing the screenplay, Raucher came to the realization that despite growing up with Oscy and having bonded with him through their formative years, the two had never really had any meaningful conversations or gotten to know one another on a more personal level. Instead, Raucher decided to focus on the first major adult experience of his life, that of falling in love for the first time. The woman -LRB-named Dorothy, like her screen counterpart-RRB- was a fellow vacationer on the island whom Raucher had befriended one day when he helped her carry groceries home; he became a friend of her and her husband and helped her with chores after her husband was called to fight in World War II. Raucher went to bed with her one night when he came to visit her, arriving only minutes after she received notification of her husband's death. The next morning, Raucher discovered that she had left the island, leaving behind a note for him -LRB-which is read at the end of the film and reproduced in the book-RRB-. He never saw her again; his last ``encounter'' with her, recounted on an episode of The Mike Douglas Show, came after the film's release in 1971, when she was one of over a dozen women who wrote letters to Raucher claiming to be ``his'' Dorothy. Raucher recognized the ``real'' Dorothy's handwriting, and she confirmed her identity by making references to certain events only she could have known about. She told Raucher that she had lived for years with the guilt that she had potentially traumatized him and ruined his life. She told Raucher that she was glad he turned out all right, and that they had best not re-visit the past. In a 2002 interview, Raucher lamented never hearing from her again and expressed his hope that she was still alive. Raucher's novelization of the screenplay, with the dedication, ``To those I love, past and present,'' serves more as the tribute to Seltzer that he had intended the film to be, with the focus of the book being more on the two boys' relationship than Raucher's relationship with Dorothy. Consequently, the book also mentions Seltzer's death, which is omitted from the film adaptation. -LSB-edit-RSB- Production Herman Raucher wrote the film script in the 1950s during his tenure as a television writer, but ``couldn't give it away.'' In the 1960s, he met Robert Mulligan, who had just finished directing To Kill a Mockingbird. Raucher showed Mulligan the script, and Mulligan took it to Warner Bros., knowing that the studio was looking for a follow up to Mockingbird. Mulligan argued the film could be shot for the relatively low price of a million dollars, and Warner approved it. They had so little faith in the film becoming a box-office success, though, they shied from paying Raucher outright for the script, instead promising him ten percent of the gross. When casting for the role of Dorothy, Warner Bros. declined to audition any actresses younger than the age of thirty; Jennifer O'Neill's agent, who had developed a fondness for the script, convinced Warner Bros. to audition his client, who was only twenty-two at the time. O'Neill auditioned for the role, albeit hesitantly, not wanting to perform any nude scenes; O'Neill ended up getting the role and Robert Mulligan agreed to find a way to make the film work without blatant nudity. Though the film took place on Nantucket, by the 1970s the island was too far modernized to be convincingly transformed to resemble a 1940s resort, so production was taken to the West Coast of the United States. Shooting took place over eight weeks, during which Jennifer O'Neill was sequestered from the three boys cast as ``The Terrible Trio,'' in order to ensure that they didn't become close and ruin the sense of awkwardness and distance that their characters felt towards Dorothy. Production ran smoothly, finishing on schedule. After production, Warner Bros., still wary about the film only being a minor success, asked Raucher to adapt his script into a book. Raucher wrote it in three weeks, and Warner Bros. released it prior to the film to build interest in the story. The book quickly became a national bestseller, so that when trailers premiered in theatres, the film was billed as being ``based on the national bestseller,'' despite the film having been completed first. Ultimately, the book became one of the best selling novels of the first half of the 1970s, requiring 23 re-prints between 1971 and 1974 to keep up with customer demand. -LSB-edit-RSB- Soundtrack The film's soundtrack consists almost entirely of compositions by Michel Legrand, many of which are variants upon ``The Summer Knows'', the film's theme. In addition to Legrand's scoring, the film also features the song ``Hold Tight'' by The Andrews Sisters and the theme from Now, Voyager. Due to this lack of songs, when the soundtrack was released, it contained not only the score to Summer, but also Legrand's composition ``The Picasso Suite.'' In spite of this, many issues of the album are still labeled as exclusively being the soundtrack to Summer, while others contain the notation in small print on the album cover ``Also contains `The Picasso Suite'''. -LSB-edit-RSB- Reception and awards The film became a blockbuster upon its release, grossing twenty-five million dollars, making it the fourth highest grossing film of 1971 and one of the most successful films in history, with an expense to profit ratio of 1:25; beyond that, it is estimated video rentals and purchases in the United States since the 1980s have produced an additional $20.5 million dollars. On this point, Raucher says his ten-percent of the gross, in addition to royalties from book sales, has ``paid bills ever since.'' As well as being a commercial success, Summer of '42 also received rave critical reviews. It went on to be nominated for over a dozen awards, including Golden Globe Awards for ``Best Motion Picture - Drama'' and ``Best Director'', and the Academy Award for ``Best Original Screenplay''. Ultimately, the film only won two awards, the ``Best Score'' Oscar'' and the BAFTA Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, both to Michel Legrand. Still, it counted among its fans Stanley Kubrick, who in a rare moment of pop-culture infusion into his films, had the film play on a television in a scene in The Shining. -LSB-edit-RSB- Sequel In 1973, the film was followed up with a sequel, Class of '44, a slice-of-life film made up of vignettes about Herman Raucher and Oscar Selzter's experiences in college prior to fighting in the Korean War. The only crew member left from Summer of '42 was Raucher himself, with a new director and composer being brought in to replace Mulligan and Legrand. Of the principal four cast members of Summer of '42, only Jerry Houser and Gary Grimes returned for prominent roles. Oliver Conant did appear in the film, albeit for less than five minutes of screen time. Jennifer O'Neill did not appear in the film at all, nor was the character of Dorothy mentioned. The film met with poor critical reviews; the only three reviews available at rottentomatoes.com are resoundingly negative, with Channel 4 calling it ``a big disappointment,'' and The New York Times stating ``The only things worth attention in `Class of 44' are the period details,'' and ''`Class of '44' seems less like a movie than 95 minutes of animated wallpaper.'' -LSB-edit-RSB- Influence Legrand's theme song for the film, ``The Summer Knows'', has since become a pop standard, being recorded by such artists as Peter Nero -LRB-who had a charting hit with his 1971 version-RRB-, Tony Bennett, Frank Sinatra, Andy Williams, and Barbra Streisand. The 1973 song ``Summer -LRB-The First Time-RRB-'' by Bobby Goldsboro has almost exactly the same subject and apparent setting, although there is no direct credited link. Bryan Adams has, however, credited the film as being a partial inspiration for his 1985 hit ``Summer of '69''. The Simpsons episode ``Summer of 4 Ft. 2'' -LRB-alternately titled `Summer of 4'2'''-RRB- was largely a parody of Summer of '42. It amalgamated scenes from another early '70s coming-of-age film, American Graffiti -LRB-both acknowledged in the DVD commentary for the episode-RRB-. There are also similarities between Summer of '42 and Malèna, another coming-of-age film set in the context of World War II, and starring Monica Bellucci and Giuseppe Sulfaro. An episode of the 1970s sitcom Happy Days was loosely based upon Summer of '42, with Richie Cunningham befriending a Korean War widow. In Family Guy episode ``Play It Again, Brian'', Brian wins an award for his essay and reads an excerpt: ``She was Grace, in name and in essence. To those she loved, she exuded strength, life, laughter and light, and to me, also sorrow for circumstance that had bound her to my best friend through whom we met in the warmth and serenity of her home. Nothing from the first day I saw her and no one that has happened to me since, has ever been as frightning and as confusing, for no person I've ever known has ever done more to make me feel more sure, more insecure, more important and less significant.'' Later in that episode, he admits that he ``ripped off'' most of the essay from Summer of '42. -LSB-edit-RSB- Remakes and re-releases In the ensuing years since the film's release, Warner Bros. has attempted to buy back Raucher's ten-percent of the film as well as his rights to the story so it could be remade; Raucher has consistently declined. The 1988 film Stealing Home shares numerous similarities not only to Summer of '42 but also Class of '44, with several incidents -LRB-most notably a subplot dealing with the premature death of the protagonist's father and the protagonist's response to it-RRB- appearing to have been directly lifted from Raucher's own life; Jennifer O'Neill stated in 2002 she believes ``Home'' was an attempted remake of ``Summer''. In 2001, Raucher consented to the film being made into an off Broadway musical play. He was on hand opening night, giving the cast a pep-talk which he concluded, ``We've now done it every possible way--except go out and piss it in the snow!'' The play met with positive critical and fan response, and was endorsed by Raucher himself, but the play was forced to close down in the aftermath of the 11 September attacks. Nevertheless, the play was enough to spark interest in the film and book with a new generation, prompting Warner to re-issue the book -LRB-which had since gone out of print, along with all of Raucher's other works-RRB- for sale with Barnes & Noble's online bookstore, and to restore the film and release it on DVD. The musical has since been performed across the country, at venues such as Kalliope Stage in Cleveland Heights, Ohio in 2004 -LRB-directed by Paul Gurgol-RRB- and Mill Mountain Theatre in Roanake, VA -LRB-directed by Jere Hodgin and choreographed by Bernard Monroe-RRB-, and was subsequently recorded as a concert by the York Theatre Company in 2006. In 2002, Jennifer O'Neill claimed to have obtained the rights to make a sequel to Summer of '42, based on a short story she wrote, which took place in an alternate reality in which Herman Raucher had a son and divorced his wife, went back to Nantucket in 1962 with a still-living Oscar Seltzer, and encountered Dorothy again and married her. As of 2006, this project--which O'Neill had hoped to produce with Lifetime television, has not been realized, and it is unknown whether O'Neill is still attempting to get it produced, or if Raucher -LRB-who technically has no say-RRB- consented to its production.

There are, however, shared rock units between all three, creating a supersequence of formations that geologists call the Grand Staircase. Together the formations of the Grand Staircase record nearly 2000 million years of the Earth's history. Bryce Canyon's formations are the youngest known units in the Grand Staircase. Younger rock units, if they ever existed, have been removed by erosion. -LSB-edit-RSB- Cretaceous Seaway -LSB-edit-RSB- Advance In the Cretaceous a shallow seaway spread into the interior of North America from the Gulf of Mexico in the south into Utah and later to the Arctic Ocean in the far north. Geologists call this shallow sea the Cretaceous Seaway or Western Interior Seaway. Whatever its name, the seaway divided North America into two halves; an eastern portion dominated by the already ancient Appalachian Mountains and a western part composed primarily of the still growing Sevier Mountains; formed from shallow thrust faulting caused by the Sevier orogeny. As the shoreline moved back and forth, the Bryce area alternated from being part of the Sevier landmass to being under the Cretaceous Seaway. Alternating layers of nonmarine, intertidal, and marine sediments lay on top of each other as a result. Conglomerate, siltstone, and fossil-rich sandstone that together are up to 300�feet -LRB-90�m-RRB- thick mark the arrival of the Cretaceous Seaway. Called the Dakota Sandstone, it is the oldest formation exposed in the Bryce Canyon area but the youngest one exposed in the Zion and Kolob canyons area to the southwest. Abundant amounts of petrified wood, oyster beds containing millions of fossils and coal are all found in the Dakota. In the Bryce Canyon area this formation can be seen in the Paria Valley where it is found as a lithified blanket sand that probably accumulated on beaches, in lagoons, and vast coal-producing swamps as the Cretaceous Seaway transgressed -LRB-advanced inland-RRB- over the region and later retreated. It sits unconformably on much older Jurassic formations that are not exposed in the immediate area -LRB-see geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area for a discussion about these older sediments-RRB-. Mud and silt were deposited on top of the Dakota Formation as the seaway became deeper and calmer in the area. The resulting dark gray to black Tropic Shale records the maximum transgression of the seaway into Utah and is 1,000�feet -LRB-300�m-RRB- thick in the Paria Amphitheater. It forms the unvegetated badlands seen in the Tropic Valley and is perhaps the most fossil-rich formation in the area; containing numerous straight-shelled and coiled ammonites. -LSB-edit-RSB- Retreat The Cretaceous Seaway was already retreating east and to the south by the time the locally 1,700�feet -LRB-520�m-RRB- thick Straight Cliffs Formation was deposited. Its members represent various stages in this process. The cliff-forming sandstone of the Tibbet Canyon Member was conformably deposited on top of the Tropic Shale in shallow marine and later near shore environments. Shale and sandstone from the Smoky Hollow Member were deposited on top of its basal layer of coal-rich mudstone in coastal swamps and lagoons on the shore of the seaway. While the alternating layers of shale and sandstone mixed with massive coal deposits of the John Henry Member were laid down in swamps, lagoons and fluvial environments one member, the Drip Tank, is not found in the Bryce Canyon area. This formation erodes into almost unclimbable cliffs and escarpments of whitish to yellow-gray sandstones with comparatively thin interbedded layers of shale and mudstone. Shark teeth are found in the lower parts of the formation. Lakes and east-flowing rivers became the dominant resting place for sediment following the retreat of the Cretaceous Seaway. The shales and sandstones of the locally 700�feet -LRB-210�m-RRB- thick Wahweap Formation were deposited in moving water -LRB-fluvial setting-RRB-. This formation is part of the Grey Cliffs of the Grand Staircase mentioned previously. It contains abundant fossils of vertebrates, including dinosaurs such as the hadrosaurs. -LSB-edit-RSB- Continental deposition -LSB-edit-RSB- Flood plains uplift and erode A flood plain crossed by rivers and lakes developed in the area. Mud and sand accumulated in this setting to become the gray sandstones and mudstones of the Kaiparowits Formation. This formation is up to 100�feet -LRB-30�m-RRB- thick in the Bryce Canyon area but other parts of the Kaiparowits in the region are several hundreds of feet -LRB-tens of meters-RRB- thick. Two formations, the Canaan Peak and the Pine Hollow, sit on top of the Kaiparowits elsewhere in the region but are absent in the Bryce Canyon area. The sandstones and conglomerates of these formations record stream and river deposition starting in the Paleocene epoch. Uplift caused by a mountain-building episode called the Laramide orogeny lasted from the late Cretaceous around 70�mya to the early Paleocene. This hoisted the once lower uplands skyward while low-lying basins between them gradually subsided. Compression from the Laramide event deformed the land in the area to form the up to 5° dipping Bryce Canyon Anticline. All of the Canaan Peak, Pine Hollow, Kaiparowits, and Waheap formations, along with part of the underlying Straight Cliffs, were removed from the anticline's crest by erosion before the Claron Formation was deposited. An angular unconformity therefore exists along the anticline's crest. The park also sits on the western gently dipping flank of the much larger Kaibab uplift, which was also formed as a result of the Laramide. -LSB-edit-RSB- Claron flood plain and lake system Uplift from the Laramide paused briefly in the Eocene. Meandering streams flowed slowly over the resulting broad and almost featureless plains. Periodic but extensive floods inundated large areas perhaps once every 1,000 years; spreading mud, cobbles and fine silt over the plains. Erosion incised these deposits between flood events and plant growth was abundant. Oxidation of the iron in the mud and silt turned the soil into hematite, giving it a pink and red hue. These sediments were later lithified into the up to 700�feet -LRB-210�m-RRB- thick Pink Member of the locally Eocene-aged Claron Formation -LRB-previously called the Wasatch Formation-RRB-. Channelized conglomerates of this member can be easily seen in Red Canyon along State Route 12 while its silt and mudstones compose most of the park's fragile and colorful spires called hoodoos. Geologist Clarence Dutton called the iron oxide-rich lower member of the Claron the Pink Cliffs series due to its colorful appearance. A large system of shallow but expansive lakes and associated deltas covered several thousand square miles of what is now northwest Colorado and southwest Utah and Wyoming. These lakes existed from the Paleocene to mid Oligocene but did not spread to the Bryce Canyon area until Eocene time. Large quantities of lakebed sediments were laid down in this system during the 20 million years of its existence from about 60 to 40�mya. Climate change and cycles caused the lakes in the system to expand and shrink through time. As they did so, they left beds of differing thickness and composition stacked atop one another;  The limey ooses and mud were later lithified into the limestone and interbedded siltstone of the up to 300�foot -LRB-90�m-RRB- thick White Member of the Claron. This member erodes into white-colored monoliths that are only found at the highest elevations of the Paunsaugunt Plateau. Fossils are rare in the White Member and mainly consist of freshwater snails and clams, indicating that the lakes supported little life. Most arches and natural bridges in the park, including the famous Natural Bridge, were carved from sandstone beds in the Claron. -LSB-edit-RSB- Marysvale volcanics A gap in the geologic record following deposition of the Claron Formation was interrupted 34 to 31�mya by eruptions from the nearby Marysvale volcanic field, which is located northwest of the park. Volcanic ash and lava from these flows are found less than 20�miles -LRB-30�km-RRB- from Bryce Canyon but at least some volcanic material was likely deposited directly in the park area only to be later removed by erosion. Most of the activity at the Marysvale volcanic field occurred during three separate intervals; ~34--22�mya, 22--14�mya and 9--5�mya. Dacites and andesites were erupted above an evolving batholith in the first interval. Crystal-rich ash from the 27�million year old -LRB-myo-RRB- Three Creeks caldera, 24�myo Big John caldera and 23�myo Monroe Peak caldera hardened into tuff. The second and third intervals saw eruptions of great quantities of rhyolites. Alkali-rich rhyolite erupted in the second interval from the 19�myo Mount Belknap caldera. The Marysvale volcanic field collapsed under its own weight around 20�mya; likely due to weaknesses in the evaporites of the Carmel Formation some 5,000�feet -LRB-1,500�m-RRB- below. Folding and faulting of the Claron Formation from the collapse created Ruby's Inn thrust. A slight downwarp running east--west and perpendicular to the thrust motion called the Bryce syncline was also created. Volcanic activity in the Marysvale and Bryce area ceased some 500,000 years ago. Basaltic rocks of the same age can be seen along the Sevier Fault near the entrance to Red Canyon; the dark colored volcanic rocks have been displaced by the fault some 900�feet -LRB-300�m-RRB- and are now in direct contact with the much older Claron Formation. -LSB-edit-RSB- Late Cenozoic tectonics -LSB-edit-RSB- Formation of the High Plateaus Younger rock units were laid down but were mostly removed by subsequent uplift-accelerated erosion. Outcrops of these formations can be found in the northern part of the park and in a few places on the plateau rim. Among these are the 50- to 100-foot-thick -LRB-15 to 30�m-RRB- Oligocene or Miocene-aged Boat Mesa Conglomerate and the Pliocene to early Pleistocene-aged Sevier River Formation. The Boat Mesa is made mostly of conglomerates with minor amounts of sandstone and some limestone from lakes, representing stream and overbank flood deposits. The brownish-gray sandstone and gravels of the Sevier River Formation were laid down in valleys that were part of the ancestral Sevier River drainage system. Around 15�mya in Miocene time, tensional forces in Nevada to the west were so great that the crust was spread thin, creating the Basin and Range Province. These same forces segmented what is now the western part of the Colorado Plateau into nine different smaller plateaus, including the Paunsaugunt that the park sits astride. Long, north--south-trending normal faults were either newly created or reactivated from older pre-existing faults; a plateau rose on one side of each fault while valleys subsided on the other as the crust was extended in an east-west direction. Two of these faults bound the Paunsaugunt Plateau; the Sevier on the west and the Paunsaugunt on the east. Movement along these two faults has displaced the Claron Formation by 2,000�feet -LRB-600�m-RRB- relative to the Paria and Sevier valleys. The Hurricane Fault marks the west edge of the Markagunt Plateau and is the topographic boundary between the Basin and Range and the Colorado Plateaus provinces. Cedar Breaks National Monument, which shares almost the same exposed geology and erosional features as Bryce Canyon National Park, sits on the west edge of the Markagunt. The entire Colorado Plateau then started to uplift from near sea level to several thousand feet -LRB-over a kilometer-RRB- in elevation. An alternate theory is that the Laramide orogeny uplifted what is today the Basin and Range and the Colorado Plateau and that the tensional forces that formed the Basin and Range caused that region to subside relative to the Colorado Plateau. Whatever the order of events were, the High Plateaus region of the Colorado Plateau were by now nearly complete. -LSB-edit-RSB- Modern drainage and erosion Drainage of the Colorado Plateau was significantly altered by the opening of the Gulf of California. Rifting tore Baja California Peninsula northwestward from the Mexican mainland starting some 10 to 5�mya. The ancestral Colorado River responded to the regional downwarping by taking a shortcut to the sea by flowing into the new gulf. This significantly decreased the distance from the river's headwaters and its delta at the sea. Water in the Colorado and its tributaries moved faster as a result and cut down deeper, creating the canyonland topography. Formation of approximately the current depth of the Colorado River's Grand Canyon by 1.2 mya further caused its tributaries to cut down even deeper. Headward erosion of one of those tributaries, the Paria River, eroded north-northwestward toward what is now Paria Amphitheater. The river took a route roughly parallel to and east of the Paunsaugunt Fault. Erosion from snow and rain that fall directly on the east-facing rim of the Paunsaugunt Plateau forms gullies that widen into alcoves and amphitheaters while differential erosion and frost wedging create the hoodoos. Streams on the plateau do not contribute to the formation of alcoves or amphitheaters because they flow away from the rim. Erosion continues in this fashion today. -LSB-edit-RSB- Hoodoo formation in Bryce Canyon The Pink Member of the Claron Formation is largely composed of easily eroded and relatively soft limestone. When rain combines with carbon dioxide it forms a weak solution of carbonic acid. This acid helps to slowly dissolve the limestone in the Claron Formation grain by grain. It is this process of chemical weathering that rounds the edges of hoodoos and gives them their lumpy and bulging profiles. In the winter, melting snow seeps into cracks and joints and freezes at night. The force of the expanding ice helps to erode the rock of the Claron Formation. Over 200 of these freeze/thaw cycles occur each year in Bryce Canyon. Frost wedging exploits and widens the nearly vertical joint planes that divide the Pink Member of the Claron Formation. Internal layers of mudstone, conglomerate and siltstone interrupt the limestone horizontally. These layers are more resistant to attack by carbonic acid and they can therefore act as protective capstones of fins, windows and hoodoos. Many of the more durable hoodoos are capped with a type of magnesium-rich limestone called dolomite. Dolomite dissolves at a much slower rate, and consequently protects the weaker limestone underneath. However, the same processes that create hoodoos will also eventually destroy them. In the case of Bryce Canyon, the hoodoos' rate of erosion is 2--4�feet -LRB-0.6--1.3�m-RRB- every 100 years. As the canyon continues to erode to the west it will eventually capture -LRB-in perhaps 3 million years-RRB- the watershed of the East Fork of the Sevier River. Once this river flows through Bryce Amphitheater it will dominate the erosional pattern; replacing hoodoos with a V-shaped canyon and steep cliff walls typical of the weathering and erosional patterns created by rivers. A foreshadowing of this can be observed in Water Canyon while hiking the Mossy Cave Trail. A diversion canal has been taking a portion of the East Fork of the Sevier River through this section of the park for over 100 years. Uplift caused by a mountain-building episode called the Laramide orogeny lasted from the late Cretaceous around 70�mya to the early Paleocene. Whatever its name, the seaway divided North America into two halves; an eastern portion dominated by the already ancient Appalachian Mountains and a western part composed primarily of the still growing Sevier Mountains; formed from shallow thrust faulting caused by the Sevier orogeny. In the Bryce Canyon area this formation can be seen in the Paria Valley where it is found as a lithified blanket sand that probably accumulated on beaches, in lagoons, and vast coal-producing swamps as the Cretaceous Seaway transgressed -LRB-advanced inland-RRB- over the region and later retreated.

The cliff-forming sandstone of the Tibbet Canyon Member was conformably deposited on top of the Tropic Shale in shallow marine and later near shore environments. -LSB-edit-RSB- Modern drainage and erosion Drainage of the Colorado Plateau was significantly altered by the opening of the Gulf of California. -LSB-edit-RSB- Grand Staircase The rocks exposed in Bryce Canyon are about 100 million years younger than those in nearby Zion National Park, and the rocks exposed in Zion are younger than those in the Grand Canyon to the south. -LSB-edit-RSB- Grand Staircase The rocks exposed in Bryce Canyon are about 100 million years younger than those in nearby Zion National Park, and the rocks exposed in Zion are younger than those in the Grand Canyon to the south.

By January 2007 wind power capacity, which has been growing rapidly, reached 1 GW capacity, and the total for renewables had grown to over 2.3 GW. By August 2009 wind power capacity was a fraction short of 1.5 GW and total renewables capacity had reached over 3.1 GW. Renewables are now contributing over 19% of total electrical production, and about 4% of all energy usage. It should be borne in mind that electricity production is only part of the overall energy use budget. In 2002, Scotland consumed a total of 175 Terawatt-hours -LRB-TWh-RRB- of energy in all forms, some 2% less than in 1990. Of this, only 20% was consumed in the form of electricity by end users, the great majority of energy utilised being from the burning of oil -LRB-41%-RRB- and gas -LRB-36%-RRB-. Scotland also has significant quantities of fossil fuel deposits, including 62.4% of the EU's proven reserves of oil, 12.5% of the EU's proven reserves of gas and 69% of UK coal reserves. Nonetheless, the Scottish Government has set ambitious targets for renewable energy production. In 2005 the aim was for 18% of Scotland's electricity production to be generated by renewable sources by 2010, rising to 40% by 2020. In 2007 this was increased to 50 per cent of electricity from renewables by 2020, with an interim target of 31 per cent by 2011. The following year new targets to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050 were announced and then confirmed in the 2009 Climate Change Delivery Plan. Maf Smith, director of the Sustainable Development Commission in Scotland said ``Governments across the world are shying away from taking the necessary action. The Scottish Government must be commended for its intention to lead the way''. An important reason for this ambition is growing international concern about human-induced climate change. The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution's proposal that carbon dioxide emissions should be reduced by 60% was incorporated into the UK government's 2003 Energy White Paper. The 2006 Stern Review proposed a 55% reduction by 2030. The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fourth Assessment Report has further increased the profile of the issue. -LSB-edit-RSB- Wind power Wind power is a renewable technology and produces no greenhouse gases during operation, although inevitably some are produced during construction and transport. The precise amounts involved are a matter of controversy. Manufacturers typically state that carbon emissions are `paid back' within 3--18 months of production, but recent research claims that turbines located on peat bogs create incidental emissions that may increase this to 8 years or more. Wind turbines are the fastest growing of the renewable energy technologies in Scotland. Most turbines in the EU produce electricity at an average of 25% of their rated maximum power due to the intermittency of wind resources, but Scotland's wind regime provides average of 40% or higher on the west and northern coasts. A small wind farm on Shetland with five Vestas V47 660�kW turbines recently achieved a world record of 58% capacity over the course of a year. There are now numerous large on-shore power stations including Black Law Wind Farm rated at over 96 MW, Hadyard Hill Wind Farm, which is the first wind farm in the UK able to generate over 100 MW, and Whitelee Wind Farm, a 322 MW project that is the largest onshore wind farm in Europe. Nevertheless the siting of turbines has become a controversial issue amongst those concerned about the value of natural landscapes. It is estimated that 11.5 GW of onshore wind potential exists, enough to provide 45 TWh of energy. More than double this amount exists on offshore sites where mean wind speeds are greater than on land. The total offshore potential is estimated at 25 GW, which although more expensive to install, could be enough to provide almost half the total energy used in Scotland. The first offshore turbines are operated by Talisman Energy, who have erected two large machines 25�kilometres -LRB-13�nmi-RRB- offshore adjacent to the Beatrice oilfield. These turbines are 88�metres -LRB-289�ft-RRB- high with the blades 63�metres -LRB-207�ft-RRB- long and have a capacity of 5 MW each, making them amongst the largest in the world. Plans to harness up to 4.8 GW of the potential in the inner Moray Firth and Firth of Forth were announced in January 2010. Moray Offshore Renewables and SeaGreen Wind Energy were awarded development contracts by the Crown Estate as part of a UK-wide initiative. -LSB-edit-RSB- Wave power Various systems are under development at present aimed at harnessing the enormous potential available for wave power off Scotland's coasts. Pelamis Wave Power -LRB-previously Ocean Power Delivery-RRB- are an Edinburgh-based company whose Pelamis system has been tested off Orkney and Portugal. These devices are 150�metres -LRB-492�ft-RRB- long, 3.5�metres -LRB-11.5�ft-RRB- diameter floating tubes which capture the mechanical action of the waves. Future wave farm projects could involve an arrangement of interlinked 750�kW machines connected to shore by a subsea transmission cable. Another approach is used by the LIMPET 500 -LRB-Land Installed Marine Power Energy Transformer-RRB- energy converter installed on the island of Islay by Wavegen Ltd.. It is a shore-based unit and generates power when waves run up the beach, creating pressure inside an inclined oscillating water column. This in turn creates pneumatic power which drives twin 250�kW the generators. Islay LIMPET was opened in 2001 and is the world's first commercial scale wave-energy device. The manufacturers are now developing a larger system in the Faroe Islands. Funding for the UK's first wave farm was announced by the Scottish Executive on 22 February 2007. It will be the world's largest, with a capacity of 3 MW generated by four Pelamis machines at a cost of over 4 million pounds. The funding is part of a new £13 million funding package for marine power projects in Scotland that will also support developments to Aquamarine's Oyster and Ocean Power Technology's PowerBuoy wave systems, AWS Ocean Energy's sub-sea wave devices, ScotRenewables' 1.2 MW floating rotor device, Cleantechcom's tidal surge plans for the Churchill barriers between various Orkney islands, the Open Hydro tidal ring turbines, and further developments to the Wavegen system proposed for Lewis as well as a further £2.5 million for the European Marine Energy Centre -LRB-EMEC-RRB- based in Orkney. This is a new Scottish Executive-backed research facility that has installed a wave testing system at Billia Croo on the Orkney mainland and a tidal power testing station on the nearby island of Eday. At the official opening of the Eday project the site was described as ``the first of its kind in the world set up to provide developers of wave and tidal energy devices with a purpose-built performance testing facility.'' The Siadar Wave Energy Project was announced in 2009. This is a 4 MW system to be built by npower Renewables and Wavegen, 400 metres off the shore of Siadar Bay, in Lewis. In early 2010 two areas were identified for substantial offshore wind development, in the Moray Firth basin and outer Firth of Forth. Shortly afterwards the Government earmarked eleven sites they expected to benefit from the construction of up to 8,000 offshore turbines by 2020. These included Campbeltown and Hunterston, four sites previously used for offshore oil fabrication at Ardersier, Nigg Bay, Arnish and Kishorn and five east coast locations from Peterhead to Leith. -LSB-edit-RSB- Tidal power Unlike wind and wave, tidal power is an inherently predictable source. However the technology is in its infancy and numerous devices are in the prototype stages. Today it is known that a tall tubular tower with three blades attached to it is the typical profile of a wind turbine, but twenty-five years ago there were a wide variety of different systems being tested. This is the current situation with regard to tidal power. Some systems capture energy from the tides in a vertical direction. The tide comes in and raises the water level in a basin. As the tide lowers the water in the basin is discharged through a turbine. Tidal stream power captures energy from the flow of tides, usually using underwater plant resembling a small wind turbine. To date the only installed tidal power plant of any size is the 240�MW rated barrage scheme at the Rance Estuary in Brittany, which has been operating successfully for more than 25 years, although there are a number of other much smaller projects around the world. An example is Marine Current Turbines SeaGen 1.2�MW device at Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland, which is the first commercial scale tidal turbine in the world. The Pentland Firth between Orkney and mainland Scotland has been described as the ``Saudi Arabia of tidal power'' and may be capable of generating up to 10 GW. In March 2010 a total of ten sites in the area, capable of providing an installed capacity of 1.2 GW of tidal and wave generation were leased out by the Crown Estates. Several other tidal sites with considerable potential exist in the Orkney archipelago. Tidal races on the west coast at Kyle Rhea between Skye and Lochalsh, the Grey Dog north of Scarba, the Dorus Mòr off Crinan and the Gulf of Corryvreckan also offer significant prospects. -LSB-edit-RSB- Hydro-electric power Scotland has 85% of the UK's hydro-electric energy resource, much of it developed by the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board in the 1950s. The ``Hydro Board'', which brought ``power from the glens'', was a nationalised industry at the time although it was privatised in 1989 and is now part of Scottish and Southern Energy plc.. Numerous remote straths were flooded by these schemes, many of the largest of which involved tunneling through mountains as well as damming rivers. Emma Wood, the author of a study of these pioneers wrote: Current capacity is 1.33 GW and includes major developments such as the 120 MW Breadalbane scheme and the 245 MW Tummel system. It is estimated that little more than another 0.3 GW remains available to develop. There is further potential for new pump storage schemes that would work well with intermittent sources of power such as wind and wave. Examples include the 440 MW Ben Cruachan and 300 MW Falls of Foyers schemes. The 100 MW Glen Doe project, currently under construction and Scotland's largest civil engineering project, is the first large scale scheme in Scotland for almost fifty years but is likely to be one of the last of its kind. There is certainly further potential for small-scale run of the river local schemes such as the existing one in Knoydart and planned for Kingussie, but the total effect of such schemes, although important locally, will be tiny on a national basis. The production of hydro electricity has a long history in Scotland but given that the available catchment areas have practically all been exploited it is unlikely that there will be scope for the further development of significant amounts of new hydro generation. -LSB-edit-RSB- Biofuels -LSB-edit-RSB- Biodiesel Various biodiesel schemes exist at present, and as with most renewables, interest is growing in the subject. Westray Development Trust operate a biodiesel vehicle fueled by the residual vegetable oils from the Orkney archipelago fish and chip outlets. On a larger scale Argent Energy's plant in Motherwell recycles tallow and used cooking oil to produce 50 million litres of biodiesel per annum. A major benefit of biodiesel is lower carbon emissions, although the energy balance of liquid biofuels is a matter of controversy. Research is being undertaken into converting rapeseed oil into biodiesel, and the European biofuels directive intends to ensure that 5.75% Europe's transport fuel comes from renewable sources by 2010. However, there is only enough used vegetable oil in the UK to contribute 0.38% of current road fuel demand and if all the arable land in the UK were turned over to biofuel crops this would still only satisfy 22% of the existing requirement for road transport. Serious concerns regarding the ethics of growing biodiesel in developing countries and importing the fuel to Europe have been raised on the grounds that they may replace much needed food crops. Converting any mainstream transport system to a renewable one also involves the conundrum that for consumers to use it the infrastructure must be in place, but high levels of use may be required to finance the infrastructure. Developments are thus slow at present and renewably powered vehicles very much the exception. Due to the relatively short growing season for sugar producing crops, ethanol is not commercially produced as a fuel in Scotland at present. However there are encouraging developments in cellulosic decomposition that might enable grass or tree crops to be used to this end in future and which may prove to have lower net carbon emissions than other production techniques. -LSB-edit-RSB- Biogas, anaerobic digestion and landfill gas Biogas, or landfill gas, is a biofuel produced through the intermediary stage of anaerobic digestion consisting mainly of 45--90% biologically produced methane and carbon dioxide. In early 2007 a thermophilic anaerobic digestion facility was commissioned in Stornoway in the Western Isles. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency -LRB-SEPA-RRB- and the Renewable Energy Association are also leading the way towards the establishment of a digestate standard to facilitate the use of solid outputs from digesters on land. Anaerobic digestion and mechanical biological treatment facilities have been planned at a number of other locations in Scotland, such as Westray. It has been recognised that biogas -LRB-mainly methane-RRB- -- produced from the anaerobic digestion of organic matter -- is potentially a valuable and prolific feedstock. It is estimated that 0.4 GW of generating capacity might be available from agricultural waste in Scotland. The Scottish Executive and SEPA has funded seven small scale farm trial plants with the British anaerobic digestion company Greenfinch in Southwest Scotland. Landfill sites have the potential for a further 0.07 GW with sites such as the Avondale Landfill in Falkirk already utilising their potential. -LSB-edit-RSB- Solid biomass Wood fuel almost certainly exceeds hydroelectric and wind as the largest source of renewable energy at present. Scotland's forests, which currently make up 60% of the UK resource base, could provide up to 1 million tonnes of wood fuel per annum. The biomass energy supply in Scotland could reach 450 MW or higher in coming years, -LRB-predominantly from wood-RRB-, with power stations requiring 4,500--5,000 oven dry tonnes per annum per megawatt of generating capacity. The energy company E.ON has constructed a 44 MW biomass power station at Lockerbie using locally sourced crops while the smaller but not insignificant EPR Westfield power plant in Fife produces 9.8 MW of output using chicken litter as fuel. The Forestry Commission are developing a Scottish Biomass Action Plan in conjunction with the Scottish Executive, and the latter is expected to provide a £7.5 million grant scheme to support biomass energy. There is growing demand for automatic wood pellet boilers which can be as convenient to use as conventional central heating systems, and which may be cheaper to run as well as being carbon neutral. There is also local potential for energy crops such as short-rotation willow or poplar coppice, miscanthus energy grass, agricultural wastes such as straw and manure, and forestry residues. These crops could provide 0.8 GW of generating capacity. -LSB-edit-RSB- Micro systems The Energy Savings Trust has estimated that micro-generation could provide a significantly increased proportion of the UK's electricity demand by 2050 although only a fraction of this would come from renewable sources. The current Scottish output is negligible. In May 2006 the then Communities Minister Malcolm Chisholm launched a Planning Advice Note aimed at promoting micro-renewables. Small-scale `wind2heat' projects, which use wind turbines to power electrical storage heaters directly, have proven to be successful in remoter rural areas; as have various other local schemes such as air source heat pumps. Whisky distilleries may have a locally important part to play. Caithness Heat and Power have announced plans to tackle fuel poverty in Wick by utilising a wood chip CHP scheme in partnership with the Old Pulteney Distillery. On the island of Islay, a swimming pool is heated using waste heat from the Bowmore distillery. In Edinburgh, Tynecastle High School, due to be completed in 2010, will be heated by waste heat from the neighbouring North British Distillery. In 2009 the Diageo Cameron Bridge distillery announced plans for a £65�million facility to generate energy from the spent ``wash'' created in the manufacturing process, which will aim to replace 95% of the plan's existing fossil fuel use. There are also a growing number of Micro hydro systems on smaller watercourses, especially in more remote rural locations. -LSB-edit-RSB- Solar energy Despite Scotland's relatively low level of sunshine hours, solar thermal panels can work effectively as they are capable of producing hot water even in cloudy weather. The technology was developed in the 1970s and is well-established with various installers in place such as Solar Power Scotland of Montrose, although AES Solar based in Forres -LRB-who provided the panels for the Scottish Parliament building-RRB- are Scotland's only manufacturer. There are few examples of photovoltaic panels, which generate electricity, in Scotland as the price is not currently competitive. The introduction of Feed-In Tariffs in April 2010 will shorten the payback period on the cost of a PV installation, making solar PV a competitive form of renewable generation. The largest installation in Scotland is a 21 kWp system at the Sir E. Scott secondary school in Tarbert, Harris. The UK's practicable resource is estimated at 7.2 TWh per annum, which in the Scottish context is the approximate equivalent of 70 MW or less of installed capacity. The ``road energy system'' uses water pipes buried beneath a layer of tarmac. In the summer, the dark asphalt is heated by the sun which in turn heats the water in the pipes. This water can be stored in an underground aquifer and the heat extracted in winter using a heat pump. The system can be used to warm or cool down roads, keeping them ice-free and/or preventing softening due to overheating. Alternatively, the stored energy can be used for cooling buildings. The system was developed in the Netherlands and has been licensed by Ullapool-based Invisible Energy Systems, who have installed the technology in their car park. -LSB-edit-RSB- Geothermal energy Geothermal energy is obtained by tapping the heat of the earth itself. Most systems in Scotland provide heating through a ground source heat pump which brings energy to the surface via shallow pipe works. An example is the Glenalmond Street project in Shettleston, which uses a combination of solar and geothermal energy to heat 16 houses. Water in a coal mine 100�metres -LRB-328�ft-RRB- below ground level is heated by geothermal energy and maintained at a temperature of about 12 °C -LRB-54 °F-RRB- throughout the year. The warmed water is raised and passed through a heat pump, boosting the temperature to 55�°C -LRB-131�°F-RRB-, and is then distributed to the houses providing heating to radiators. Although the pumps may not be powered from renewable sources, up to four times the energy used can be recovered. Installation costs can vary from £7,000 to £10,000, and grants may be available from the Scottish Community and Householders Renewables Initiative operated by Community Energy Scotland for domestic properties up to a maximum of £4,000. Perhaps up to 7.6 TWh of energy is available on an annual basis from this source. -LSB-edit-RSB- Other means of reducing carbon emissions It is clear that if carbon emissions are to be reduced, a combination of increased production from renewables and decreased consumption of energy in general and fossil fuels in particular will be required. On the latter front, Gordon Brown, the then UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced in November 2006 that within a decade all new houses would have to be `zero carbon'. A variety of other options exist, most of which may affect development of renewable technologies even if they are not means of producing energy from renewable sources themselves. -LSB-edit-RSB- Other renewable options Various other ideas for renewable energy in the early stages of development, such as ocean thermal energy conversion, deep lake water cooling, and blue energy, have received little attention in Scotland, presumably because the potential is so significant for less speculative technologies. -LSB-edit-RSB- Carbon offsetting Carbon offsetting involves individuals or organisations compensating for their use of fossil fuels by making payments to projects that aim to neutralise the effect of these carbon emissions. Although the idea has become fashionable, the theory has received serious criticism of late. Nonetheless, a credible option may be to plant trees within the local bioregion and maintain the forest on a permanent basis, thus locking up carbon produced by burning fossil fuels. In British growing conditions this method can compensate for carbon at a rate of 200 tonnes per square kilometre -LRB-0.89�tons/acre-RRB- planted over a 100 year period. Thus a 4-square-kilometre -LRB-988-acre-RRB- plantation could uptake 200 tonnes -LRB-220�tons-RRB- of carbon over twenty-five years. This is the equivalent of 10,000 tonnes -LRB-11,000�short tons-RRB- of carbon dioxide. The weaknesses of the approach include uncertainty as to whether the planting might have occurred anyway and who, in the future, will ensure permanence. However, there is likely to be a greater level of credibility inherent in a nearby and visible scheme than in a far-distant one. -LSB-edit-RSB- Challenges and opportunities offered by non-renewables The following technologies are means of reducing the effect of carbon emissions and form an important aspect of the energy debate in Scotland and are included here for completeness. Their effect is likely to influence the future direction of commercial renewable energy, but they are not renewable forms of energy production themselves. Carbon sequestration: Also known as carbon capture and storage, this technology involves the storage of carbon dioxide -LRB-CO2-RRB- that is a by-product of industrial processes through its injection into oil fields. It is not a form of renewable energy production, but it may be a way to significantly reduce the effect of fossil fuels whilst renewables are commercialised. It may also be an intermediate step towards a `hydrogen economy' -LRB-see below-RRB-, which could either enable further renewable development or conceivably out-compete it. The technology has been successfully pioneered in Norway but is still a relatively untried concept. `Clean coal' technology: It is has been estimated that it will be 2020 to 2025 before any commercial-scale clean coal power stations -LRB-coal-burning power stations with carbon capture and sequestration-RRB- are widely adopted. Moreover, some have criticised the clean coal approach and it is at best a means of ameliorating carbon emissions. It is not a form of renewable energy production, although like carbon sequestration it offers a significant commercial challenge to renewable developments. In 2009 a licence to test underground coal gassification technology in Fife was granted to Thornton New Energy. However, a plan to build a new ``clean coal'' power station at Hunterston collapsed in 2009 after financial backing was withdrawn. Nuclear power: Renewable energy as a concept generally excludes nuclear power although this stance has been challenged. Incineration: There is a successful waste-to-energy incineration plant at Lerwick in Shetland which burns 22,000 tonnes -LRB-24,250�tons-RRB- of waste every year and provides district heating to over 600 customers. Although such plants generate carbon emissions through the combustion of the biological material and plastic wastes -LRB-which derive from fossil fuels-RRB-, they also reduce the damage done to the atmosphere from the creation of methane in landfill sites. This is a much more damaging greenhouse gas than the carbon dioxide the burning process produces, although other systems which do not involve district heating may have a similar carbon footprint to straightforward landfill degradation. -LSB-edit-RSB- Hydrogen Although hydrogen offers significant potential as an alternative to hydrocarbons as a carrier of energy, neither hydrogen itself nor the associated fuel cell technologies are sources of energy in themselves. Nevertheless, the combination of renewable technologies and hydrogen is of considerable interest to those seeking alternatives to fossil fuels. There are a number of Scottish projects involved in this research, supported by the Scottish Hydrogen & Fuel Cell Association -LRB-SHFCA-RRB-. The PURE project on Unst in Shetland is a ground-breaking training and research centre which uses a combination of the ample supplies of wind power and fuel cells to create a wind hydrogen system. Two 15�kW turbines are attached to a `Hypod' fuel cell, which in turn provides power for heating systems, the creation of stored liquid hydrogen and an innovative fuel-cell driven car. The project is community-owned and part of the Unst Partnership, the community's development trust. In the Western Isles a plan to enable a £10 million waste management plant into a hydrogen production facility was announced in June 2006. The Council have also agreed to purchase hydrogen-fuelled buses and hope the new plant, which will be constructed in partnership with the local Hydrogen Research Laboratory, will supply island filling stations and houses and the industrial park at Arnish. ITI Energy is a company with the aim of funding Research and Development programmes in the energy sector. It is a division of ITI Scotland, which also includes a life sciences and digital media division. ITI Energy has attracted the Alterg project, a French company that is developing technology for the cost-effective storage of hydrogen. In July 2008 the SHFCA announced plans for a ``hydrogen corridor'' from Aberdeen to Peterhead. The proposal involves running hydrogen powered buses along the A 90 and is supported by Aberdeenshire Council and the Royal Mail. The economics and practical application of hydrogen vehicles are currently being investigated by the University of Birmingham in England. The ``Hydrogen Office'' in Methil aims to demonstrate the benefits of improved energy efficiency and renewable and hydrogen energy systems. -LSB-edit-RSB- Local vs national concerns A significant feature of Scotland's renewable potential is that the resources are largely distant from the main centres of population. This is by no means coincidental. The power of wind, wave and tide on the north and west coasts and for hydro in the mountains makes for dramatic scenery, but sometimes harsh living conditions. W. H. Murray described the Hebrides as ``the Isles on the Edge of the Sea where men are welcome--if they are hard in body and in spirit tenacious.'' This happenstance of geography and climate has created various tensions. There is clearly a significant difference between a renewable energy production facility of modest size providing an island community with all its energy needs, and an industrial scale power station in the same location that is designed to export power to far distant urban locations. Thus, plans for one of the world's largest onshore windfarms on the Hebridean island of Lewis, have generated considerable debate. A related issue is the planned high-voltage Beauly--Denny power line which will bring electricity from renewable projects in the north and west to the cities of the south. The matter went to a public inquiry and has been described by Ian Johnston of The Scotsman as a ``battle that pitches environmentalists against conservationists and giant energy companies against aristocratic landowners and clan chiefs''. In January 2010 Jim Mather, the Energy Minister, announced that the project would be going ahead, notwithstanding the more than 18,000 objections received. There is considerable support for community-scale energy projects. For example, Alex Salmond, First Minister of Scotland, has stated that ``we can think big by delivering small'' and aspires to have a ``million Scottish households with access to their own or community renewable generation within ten years''. The John Muir Trust has also stated that ``the best renewable energy options around wild land are small-scale, sensitively sited and adjacent to the communities directly benefiting from them'', although even community-owned schemes can prove controversial. A related issue is the position of Scotland within the United Kingdom. It has been alleged that UK transmission pricing structures are weighted against the development of renewables in Scotland, a debate which highlights the contrast between the sparsely populated north of Scotland and the highly urbanised south and east of England. Although the ecological footprints of Scotland and England are similar the relationship between this footprint and the biocapacities of the respective countries are not. Scotland's biocapacity -LRB-a measure of the biologically productive area-RRB- is 4.52 global hectares -LRB-gha-RRB- per head, some 15% less than the current ecological effect. In other words, with a 15% reduction in consumption, the Scottish population could live within the productive capacity of the land to support them. However, the UK ecological footprint is more than three times the biocapacity, which is only 1.6 gha head, amongst the lowest in Europe. Thus, to achieve the same end in the UK context, consumption would have to be reduced by about 66%. The developed world's economy is presently very dependent on inexpensive `point-source' fossil fuels. Scotland, as a relatively sparsely populated country with significant renewable resources, is in a unique position to demonstrate how the transition to a low-carbon, widely distributed energy economy may be undertaken. A balance will need to be struck between supporting this transition and providing exports to the economies of densely populated regions in the Central Belt and elsewhere, as they seek their own solutions. The tension between local and national needs in the Scottish context may therefore also play out on the wider UK and European stage. -LSB-edit-RSB- Promotion of renewables Growing national concerns regarding ``peak oil'' and climate change have driven the subject of renewable energy high up the political agenda. Various public bodies and public-private partnerships have been created to develop the potential. The Forum for Renewable Energy Development in Scotland, -LRB-FREDS-RRB- is a partnership between industry, academia and Government aimed at enabling Scotland to capitalise on its renewable energy resource. The Scottish Renewables Forum is an important intermediary organisation for the industry, hosting the annual Green Energy Awards. Community Energy Scotland provides advice, grant funding and finance for renewable energy projects developed by community groups. Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group -LRB-AREG-RRB- is a public-private partnership created to identify and promote renewable energy opportunities for businesses in the north-east. In 2009 AREG formed an alliance with North Scotland Industries Group to help promote the North of Scotland as an ``international renewable energy hub''. The Forestry Commission is active in promoting the biomass potential. The Climate Change Business Delivery Group aims to act as a way for businesses to share best practice and address the climate change challenge. Numerous universities are playing a role in supporting energy research under the Supergen programme, including fuel cell research at St Andrews, marine technologies at Edinburgh, distributed power systems at Strathclyde and biomass crops at the UHI Millennium Institute's Orkney College. -LSB-edit-RSB- Recent events New data appears on a regular basis and milestones in 2007-9 include the following. In February 2007 the commissioning of the Braes of Doune wind farm took the UK renewables installed capacity up to 2 GW. Total Scottish capacity at October 2007 was 1.13 GW from 760 turbines and increased to 1.3 GW by September 2008 and 1.48 GW by August 2009. The Robin Rigg 180 MW wind farm in the Solway Firth, Scotland first large offshore wind farm, is expected to commence production in the summer of 2009. Also during 2007 Scottish and Southern Energy plc in conjunction with the University of Strathclyde began the implementation of a `Regional Power Zone' in the Orkney archipelago. This ground-breaking scheme -LRB-that may be the first of its kind in the world-RRB- involves `active network management' that will make better use of the existing infrastructure and allow a further 15MW of new `non-firm generation' output from renewables onto the network. Heat and Power Ltd. of Westray are involved in developing an innovative digestor system that is being trialled at Tuquoy farm. Designed by Sam Harcus and Colin Risbridger, it is capable of handling up to 1,500 tonnes of feedstock per annum. Scottish & Southern Energy have been asked to provide for an export capacity of 40kWe. The aim is to help move the farm towards being powered by 100% renewable energy. In January 2008 it was reported that Professor Graeme Walker of the University of Abertay is leading a project aimed at using grain that is a by-product of whisky distilling as a biofuel. In February 2008 plans to build a 10MW prototype tidal energy plant in the Pentland Firth were announced by Tocardo Tidal Energy Ltd. of Wick. Production is expected to commence in 2009. The following September, Scottish Power announced plans for two tidal projects in the same area, pending successful tests of a £6 million prototype. In January 2009 the government announced the launch of a ``Marine Spatial Plan'' to map the potential of the Pentland Firth and Orkney coasts and agreed to take part in a working group examining options for an offshore grid to connect renewable energy projects in the North Sea to on-shore national grids. In July 2009 a new study called ``The Power of Scotland Renewed'' was published. Its findings indicated that the country could meet all its electricity needs by 2030 without the requirement for either nuclear or fossil fuel powered installations. -LSB-edit-RSB- Summary of Scotland's resource potential Table notes a. ^ Note on `installed capacity' and `potential energy'. The former is an estimate of the maximum productive output of a given technology or individual generation station at a single point in time. The latter takes into account the likely intermittency of energy supply and is a measure of output over a period of time. Thus, for example, individual wind turbines may have a `capacity factor' of between 15% and 45% depending on their location, with a higher capacity factor giving a greater potential energy output for a given installed capacity. The `potential energy' column is thus an estimate based on a variety of assumptions including the installed capacity. Although `potential energy' is in some ways a more useful method of comparing the current output and future potential of different technologies, using it would require cumbersome explanations of all the assumptions involved in each example, so installed capacity figures are generally used. b.

From 1949, it evolved into conventional warfare, due largely to aid from the People's Republic of China -LRB-``PRC''-RRB- to the north. Subsequently, the French strategy of occupying small, poorly defended outposts throughout Indochina, particularly along the Vietnamese-Chinese border, was failing. Thanks to the terrain and the close border with China, the Viet Minh had succeeded in turning a ``clandestine guerrilla movement into a powerful conventional army'', something which previously had never been encountered by the western world. In October 1952, fighting around the Red River Delta spread into the Thai Highlands, resulting in the battle of Na San, at which the Viet Minh were defeated. The French used the lessons learned at Na San -- strong ground bases, versatile air support, and a model based on the British Burma campaign -- as the basis for their new strategy. The Viet Minh, however, remained unbeatable in the highland regions of Vietnam, and the French ``could not offset the fundamental disadvantages of a roadbound army facing a hill and forest army in a country which had few roads but a great many hills and forests''. In May 1953, General Henri Navarre arrived to take command of the French forces, replacing General Raoul Salan. Navarre spoke of a new offensive spirit in Indochina -- based on strong, fast-moving forces -- and the media quickly took Operation Camargue to be the ``practical realization'' of that. -LSB-edit-RSB- Chinese and American backing Following the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War in 1949, the Viet Minh established close ties with China. It enabled the Chinese to expand their area of influence into Indochina and the Viet Minh to receive much needed Chinese matériel and strategical planning support. From mid-1950, PRC military advisers were seconded to the Viet Minh at battalion, regiment and divisional level. The common border meant that ``China became a `sanctuary' where the Viet Minh could be trained and refitted''. When the Korean War broke out, Indochina became ``an important pawn in cold war strategy''. In December 1950, the United States, concerned about growing Chinese Communist influence, started providing military aid to the French, with a first payment of US$15 million. In the spring of 1953, the Viet Minh launched campaigns in Laos and succeeded in linking up Laotian territorial gains with their bases in north-western Vietnam. Meanwhile, the winding down of the Korean War meant that China was able ``to give much more attention to its southern neighbour''. Similarly, the US ``released from its heavy burden in the Korean conflict ... dramatically increased its military and financial support'' to the French. By June 1953, the US ``had sent: 1,224 tanks and combat vehicles; 120,792 rifles and machine guns; more than 200 million rifle and machine gun cartridges; more than five million artillery projectiles; 302 boats and 304 aircraft'' -LRB-by end of the war, total US aid would amount to nearly four billion dollars-RRB-. -LSB-edit-RSB- Prelude to the battle Route One, also known as Route Coloniale One -LRB-or RC1-RRB-, had been the main north--south artery along the coastline of North Vietnam since the outbreak of violence in 1949. Communications and convoys along these lines suffered from regular attacks by Viet Minh irregulars, despite efforts by the French during 1952 in Operation Sauterelle. The Viet Minh paramilitary forces around Road One originated mainly from a region of fortified villages dispersed along sand dunes and salt marshes between Hué to the south, and Quang-Tri to the north. French forces had suffered from Viet Minh ambushes, an attack that the latter had become very proficient at throughout the war, most notably in the annihilation of Group Mobiles 42 and 100. The roads in Vietnam were almost all closed during the night and ``abandoned to the enemy''. Between 1952 and 1954, 398 armored vehicles were destroyed, 84% of them from mines and booby traps. Typically, the Viet Minh ambushed convoys by obstructing the road with a fallen tree or pile of boulders, and then destroying the first and last vehicles of the halted convey with remote mines. Caltraps, mines and the steep cliff faces naturally found at the road side aided in funneling the target convoy into a small area, where machine guns, mortars and recoilless rifles were trained. Viet Minh Regiment 95 repeatedly deployed these tactics, inflicting severe losses on the French forces passing along Road One, which led to its French nickname of la rue sans joie -LRB-``the street without joy''-RRB-. Regiment 95 was, along with Regiments 18 and 101, part of the Viet Minh Division 325, commanded by General Tran Quy Ha. The division was formed in 1951 from pre-existing units in Thua Thien just north of Road One, and became operational in the summer of 1952. By early summer 1953, thanks in part to the wind-down of hostilities in the Korean War, the French command had ``sufficient reserves'' at hand to begin clearing the Viet Minh back from Road One. They assembled 30 battalions, two armored regiments and two artillery regiments for one of the largest operations of the conflict. Called Operation Camargue, it was named for the sandy marshland to the west of Marseilles, France. The difficult terrain was to prove the decisive factor and gave a major advantage to the one Viet Minh regiment tasked with defending the Street Without Joy. From a 100-meter -LRB-109�yd-RRB- deep beach of ``hard sand'' the French landing forces were to advance through a series of dunes. The dunes were up to 20�meters -LRB-22�yd-RRB- high and interspersed with precipices, ditches and a handful of small villages. Beyond this was an 800-meter -LRB-875�yd-RRB- belt of pagodas and temples, which war correspondent Bernard Fall describes as having excellent defensive potential. Beyond these temples was Road One itself with a series of closely packed and fortified villages, including Tan An, My Thuy, Van Trinh and Lai-Ha. This network of villages and hedgerows made both ground and air surveillance difficult. Across from Road One the villages continued amid an area of quicksand, swamps and bogs, which would stop all but a few of the vehicles at the disposal of the French. Although there were roads, most were mined or damaged. Throughout the area, the civilian population remained and provided a further complication for the French high command. -LSB-edit-RSB- French order of battle The French divided their forces into four Groupement mobiles -LRB-``mobile groups''-RRB-: A through D. Group A consisted of Mobile Group 14, which contained 3rd Amphibious Group, 2nd Marine Commando, 2nd Battalion 1st Colonial Parachute Regiment, and 3rd Vietnamese Parachute Battalion. Operation Camargue was to be one of the final proving grounds for the use of French armor during the war. It was to land on the beach in line with the center of Road One. Meanwhile, Group B was to advance over land from the west of the north-east facing beach. This group consisted of Mobile Group Central Vietnam's 6th Moroccan Spahis, 2nd Amphibious Group, a tank platoon from 1st Foreign Cavalry Regiment, and two infantry companies from the Quang-Tri military base. Group C was to advance from the south-west into the back of Van Trinh through the swamps, and consisted of the 9th Moroccan Tabor, 27th Vietnamese Infantry Battalion, 2nd Battalion of the 4th Moroccan Rifle Regiment, 1 Commando, a tank platoon of the Moroccan Colonials, an Armored Patrol Boat Platoon, and an LCM Platoon. Group D consisted of 3rd Battalion of the 3rd Algerian Rifles, the 7th Amphibious Group, and a Commando group, and was to land at the south-east end of the beach, below Group A. These forces in total formed ``two amphibious forces, three land-borne groupments and one airborne force'' all of which was commanded by General Leblanc. This French force, vastly outnumbering the Viet Minh regiment opposing it, was tasked with sealing the Communist forces into a tight pocket, and systematically destroying them, as well as capturing as many prisoners, arms caches and as much equipment as possible. -LSB-edit-RSB- Securing the Street Without Joy -LSB-edit-RSB- French landing On 27 July 1953, the French landing craft departed from their assembly points, and by 04:00 on the following had begun disembarking 160 amphibious landing craft belonging to Group A's 3rd Amphibious opposite the coastline. By 06:00, these vehicles had landed on the beach and proceeded to occupy sand ridges overlooking the dunes beyond. Proceeding into the dunes, the vehicles of 3rd Amphibious became stuck in the sand; in the meantime, other regular infantry elements of Group A were experiencing more difficulties in the sea, taking two extra hours to reach the beach. Thus unsupported, elements of 3rd Amphibious that either disembarked floundering vehicles or were pushed, managed to escape the dunes and advance between Tan An and My Thuy. The French amphibious vehicles were the World War II-era 29-C cargo carriers, nicknamed the Crab or Crabe and LVT 4 or 4As, known as the Alligator. The latter was armed with two .30 caliber and two .50 caliber Browning machine guns and an M20 recoilless rifle. While the Alligators were heavily armored and well suited to the water, they struggled on land. In contrast, the Crab had difficulty in water and its large size presented too great a target on land; however, it was lighter and more maneuverable, except in paddy fields where its suspension became clogged with vegetation. While Group A's forward elements were breaching the dune barrier unopposed, two of Group B's battalions crossed the Van Trinh Canal. By 07:45, when they made visual contact with the Crabs and Alligators of Group A, they had succeeded in sealing off the northern escape route of Regiment 95. By 08:30, the 6th Moroccan Spahis also reached the canal, having had difficulty crossing the swamps on the landward side with their M24 Chaffee tanks. No French units, as yet, had made any major contact with the Viet Minh. A minor fire-fight had taken place on the southern edge of Group B's advance when an Algerian company exchanged fire with 20--30 Viet Minh and suffered the first French fatalities. Simultaneously, Group C had advanced into the center of the area of operation, and executed ``the most complicated maneuver of the operation''. This involved crossing Road One and sealing off the land side of the operational area, and was completed by 08:30. Group D, finally, was tasked with advancing south from its landing point to close off an escape route that ran between the sea and an inland lagoon towards the city of Hué. Landing at 04:30, the group made quick progress through the beach and dunes, secured the small city of Thé Chi Dong and hit the north coast of the lagoon by 05:30, thereby sealing off that escape route with no enemy contact. The final act of sealing the noose was to move some of the French Navy vessels north to the Vietnamese villages of Ba-Lang and An-Hoi where any attempt by Regiment 95 to flee by sea would have taken place. -LSB-edit-RSB- Tightening the loop With the landings and the encirclement of Regiment 95 complete and the net deemed secure, the French forces began the second phase of the operation and began to sweep through the area for the encircled Viet Minh. Each French group began to move through the villages around Road One in an attempt to locate the Viet Minh forces. Group B, which was lined up along the canal -- the jump-off point for the second phase of the operation -- moved to sweep the northern villages while Group C did the same further south. The method of searching each village was to seal it off entirely with encircling troops, and then inspect it with a heavily armed unit of minesweepers and K-9 teams. Men of military age were arrested and screened by intelligence officers. This process was time-consuming, and by 11:00 Group B had traveled 7�kilometers -LRB-4.3�mi-RRB- through the network of villages with no results or resistance. At this time, the 6th Moroccan Spahis entered the village of Dong-Qué with their M-24 tanks and the support of the 1st Battalion of the Moroccan Rifles and the artillery of Colonel Piroth -LRB-later commander of the artillery at the battle of Dien Bien Phu-RRB- and his 69th African Artillery Regiment. The Moroccan infantry took the lead, and the French commanders sealed themselves in their tank turrets and advanced behind. Viet Minh forces, which were waiting in ambush, fired almost the same instant as the lead Moroccan units who noticed their presence. The Moroccan forces spread out into the surrounding rice paddies, and the bazookas of the Viet Minh missed the French tanks. The French commander called in Piroth's artillery and Dong-Qué ``disintegrated under the impact of their high-angle fire'', particularly when a French shell found the Viet Minh ammunition depot. As the French tanks approached, the Viet Minh drove the civilians out to clog up the entrance to the village, however as the Viet Minh retreated they were spotted through the civilians by the Moroccan infantry and killed by 13:00. During this battle, however, most of the Regiment 95 personnel who had been elsewhere managed to escape towards the southern end of the French encirclement. Leblanc had realized the intentions of Regiment 95's commander, and had requested one of the two reserve paratroop units to be deployed at the border between the network of temples and the dune-filled area in front of where Group D had originally landed. This paratroop unit, 2nd Battalion of the 1st Colonial Parachute Regiment, began to advance towards the canal at 10:45, 15 minutes before Group B entered Dong-Qué. Group C's 9th Tabor had also, like the M-24's of Group B, struggled through the marshes during the first phase of the operation, and were late in arriving at the jumping-off point for phase two, the canal. At 08:45, Moroccan units of Group C were investigating the village of Phu-An on the opposite side of the lagoon from Group D's landing area, when they came under heavy fire. Despite being nearer to Group D, the engaged units radioed their immediate commanders back in Group C, who were by now some distance away, further inland. This delay, coupled with the failure of many of the units SCR300 radios, meant that these advance elements of Group C failed to get through until 09:10. At 09:40, the commander of Group C called up various reinforcements from Hué including two companies of Vietnamese trainee NCOs and five infantry companies, two of which came via landing craft and did not reach the beleaguered elements of Group C until 18:00, half an hour after the Moroccans had finally counter-attacked and occupied Phu-An. The 2nd Battalion of the Parachute Chasseurs Regiment had been requested to drop at 14:00 to support the advanced elements of Group C but did not jump until 16:50 and thus failed to assemble before the Moroccans themselves occupied Phu-An. With the final capture of Phu-An, the extreme southern tip of the encirclement, the pincer movement was complete. -LSB-edit-RSB- Escape of Regiment 95 By 17:30, with Phu-An captured, all French reserves now committed, and one half of the pocket fully swept by Groups B and A at the northern end of the battlefield, the French appeared to have gained the upper hand. By now, the expected windfall of arms caches and prisoners should have taken place. However, the unexpected time taken to capture Phu-An, and the delayed arrival of the paratroop reinforcements who had been scattered by the winds, had left a gap between Phu-An and the southern edge of the lagoon. This 12-kilometer -LRB-7.5�mi-RRB- gap was eventually covered by only four French battalions, leaving gaps through which the Viet Minh could escape. Crabs and Alligators were stationed on, or in some cases in, the canal network, and French infantry were scattered across the edge of the pocket throughout that night in order to detect escaping Viet Minh. However, despite the occasional shot, flare and searchlight, no Viet Minh were detected. On the morning of 29 July 1953, the French forces continued to advance into the remaining 23-square-kilometer -LRB-9�sq�mi-RRB- pocket, encountering neither Viet Minh nor civilian. Groups A, B and D reached the edge of the canal opposite Group C by 13:00, having retrieved a small number of suspected Viet Minh and a ``few weapons''. At this time, however, a Morane aircraft detected the movement of elements of Regiment 95 towards An-Hoi on the extreme northern corner of the operational area, outside of the pocket. The French carried out a raid on An-Hoi by commando groups and elements of Group A, which took place at 15:00 and returned with suspected Viet Minh by 18:00. The French then undertook a methodical house-to-house search of the entire area, sweeping each village, and the surrounding paddy fields and jungle, risking encounter with Viet Minh caltrops. Meanwhile, 2nd and 3rd Amphibious used their Crabs and Alligators to herd prisoners towards Trung-An for interrogation. By the end of 29 July, with resistance to the French forces having ceased, a general withdrawal of paratroopers, amphibious groups and marines began. -LSB-edit-RSB- Aftermath -LSB-edit-RSB- Rebuilding and reaction After the departure of all but regular French infantry, efforts to make the area suitable for permanent occupation by French forces and French-friendly civilians began. This involved the rebuilding of road and rail links -LRB-a rail line ran alongside Road One-RRB-, the repairing of infrastructure, demining, the installation of new Vietnamese government administrators, and the provision of ``everything from rice to anti-malaria tablets''. Over 24 villages were placed under the authority of the Vietnamese government, and Regiment 95 had been driven from the area. In comparison to Fall, South Vietnamese general Lam Quang Thi states in his memoirs that Operation Camargue was ``one of the most successful French military operations during the Indochina war'' in the area of Road One. Newspapers stated that the operation had been a ``total success, demonstrating once more the new aggressiveness and mobility'' of the French forces. However, in the days following the end of the fighting, press reports on the French failure to capture the anticipated large numbers of Viet Minh began to appear though the British newspaper, The Times, did publish claimed casualty figures of 1,550 for the Viet Minh, 200 of which killed. This estimate was altered by the French the next day to 600 killed or wounded and 900 captured, and it was suggested that the operation did ``not appear to have been successful''. In contrast to these figures, Bernard Fall records 182 Viet Minh casualties and 387 prisoners. He also notes that ``51 rifles, eight sub-machine guns, two mortars, and five BARs'' were captured. Of the prisoners, however, it is not recorded how many were confirmed to be members of Regiment 95. Both Fall and the newspapers published in the days following the official termination of the operation on 10 August 1953, give French casualties as 17 dead and 100 wounded. Giap wrote ``it was announced we suffered heavy losses although in fact our losses were insignificant ... their troops had to withdraw with heavy losses''. Fall goes on to record that the ``major defect'' of Operation Camargue was that the French had nothing like the numerical superiority to encircle a force in the terrain around Road One, 15:1 as opposed to the 20:1 or 25:1 that he believed required. He states that the slow French progress -LRB-around 1,500 yards an hour-RRB- and the large distances each unit had to guard from Viet Minh infiltration meant that the Viet Minh could easily escape the net. He also states that Viet Minh intelligence were always aware of French movements, as the size of French units and the complex technology involved in the operation gave its presence and intentions away almost immediately, whereas in contrast the simpler Viet Minh operations were far more difficult to detect. -LSB-edit-RSB- Road One and Regiment 95 Regiment 95 survived Operation Camargue and resumed ambushes in 1954, as well as assaulting a Vietnamese garrison near Hué. The regiment remained in the area, taking part in General Giap's 1954 campaign season, until Vietnam was split into North and South Vietnam by the cease-fire, whereupon it infiltrated back to the north along Road One during broad daylight, leaving small cells of guerillas in the area. The regiment returned to resume ambushes of the South Vietnamese Army in 1962. This French force, vastly outnumbering the Viet Minh regiment opposing it, was tasked with sealing the Communist forces into a tight pocket, and systematically destroying them, as well as capturing as many prisoners, arms caches and as much equipment as possible.

The French carried out a raid on An-Hoi by commando groups and elements of Group A, which took place at 15:00 and returned with suspected Viet Minh by 18:00. The regiment returned to resume ambushes of the South Vietnamese Army in 1962. The regiment returned to resume ambushes of the South Vietnamese Army in 1962. This French force, vastly outnumbering the Viet Minh regiment opposing it, was tasked with sealing the Communist forces into a tight pocket, and systematically destroying them, as well as capturing as many prisoners, arms caches and as much equipment as possible. The regiment returned to resume ambushes of the South Vietnamese Army in 1962. -LSB-edit-RSB- Characteristics Heavy metal is traditionally characterized by loud distorted guitars, emphatic rhythms, dense bass-and-drum sound, and vigorous vocals. Metal subgenres variously emphasize, alter, or omit one or more of these attributes. New York Times critic Jon Pareles writes, ``In the taxonomy of popular music, heavy metal is a major subspecies of hard-rock--the breed with less syncopation, less blues, more showmanship and more brute force.'' The typical band lineup includes a drummer, a bassist, a rhythm guitarist, a lead guitarist, and a singer, who may or may not be an instrumentalist. Keyboard instruments are sometimes used to enhance the fullness of the sound. The electric guitar and the sonic power that it projects through amplification has historically been the key element in heavy metal. The lead role of the guitar in heavy metal often collides with the traditional ``frontman'' or bandleader role of the vocalist, creating a musical tension as the two ``contend for dominance'' in a spirit of ``affectionate rivalry''. Heavy metal ``demands the subordination of the voice'' to the overall sound of the band. Reflecting metal's roots in the 1960s counterculture, an ``explicit display of emotion'' is required from the vocals as a sign of authenticity. Critic Simon Frith claims that the metal singer's ``tone of voice'' is more important than the lyrics. Metal vocals vary widely in style, from the multioctave, theatrical approach of Judas Priest's Rob Halford and Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickinson, to the gruff style of Motörhead's Lemmy and Metallica's James Hetfield, to the growling of many death metal performers. The prominent role of the bass is also key to the metal sound, and the interplay of bass and guitar is a central element. The bass guitar provides the low-end sound crucial to making the music ``heavy''. Metal basslines vary widely in complexity, from holding down a low pedal point as a foundation to doubling complex riffs and licks along with the lead and/or rhythm guitars. Some bands feature the bass as a lead instrument, an approach popularized by Metallica's Cliff Burton in the early 1980s. The essence of metal drumming is creating a loud, constant beat for the band using the ``trifecta of speed, power, and precision''. Metal drumming ``requires an exceptional amount of endurance'', and drummers have to develop ``considerable speed, coordination, and dexterity...to play the intricate patterns'' used in metal. A characteristic metal drumming technique is the cymbal choke, which consists of striking a cymbal and then immediately silencing it by grabbing it with the other hand -LRB-or, in some cases, the same striking hand-RRB-, producing a burst of sound. The metal drum setup is generally much larger than those employed in other forms of rock music. In live performance, loudness--an ``onslaught of sound,'' in sociologist Deena Weinstein's description--is considered vital. In his book Metalheads, psychologist Jeffrey Arnett refers to heavy metal concerts as ``the sensory equivalent of war.'' Following the lead set by Jimi Hendrix, Cream and The Who, early heavy metal acts such as Blue Cheer set new benchmarks for volume. As Blue Cheer's Dick Peterson put it, ``All we knew was we wanted more power.'' A 1977 review of a Motörhead concert noted how ``excessive volume in particular figured into the band's impact.'' Weinstein makes the case that in the same way that melody is the main element of pop and rhythm is the main focus of house music, powerful sound, timbre, and volume are the key elements of metal. She argues that the loudness is designed to ``sweep the listener into the sound'' and to provide a ``shot of youthful vitality.'' -LSB-edit-RSB- Musical language -LSB-edit-RSB- Rhythm and tempo The rhythm in metal songs is emphatic, with deliberate stresses. Weinstein observes that the wide array of sonic effects available to metal drummers enables the ``rhythmic pattern to take on a complexity within its elemental drive and insistency.'' In many heavy metal songs, the main groove is characterized by short, two-note or three-note rhythmic figures--generally made up of 8th or 16th notes. These rhythmic figures are usually performed with a staccato attack created by using a palm-muted technique on the rhythm guitar. Brief, abrupt, and detached rhythmic cells are joined into rhythmic phrases with a distinctive, often jerky texture. These phrases are used to create rhythmic accompaniment and melodic figures called riffs, which help to establish thematic hooks. Heavy metal songs also use longer rhythmic figures such as whole note- or dotted quarter note-length chords in slow-tempo power ballads. The tempos in early heavy metal music tended to be ``slow, even ponderous.'' By the late 1970s, however, metal bands were employing a wide variety of tempos. In the 2000s, metal tempos range from slow ballad tempos -LRB-quarter note = 60 beats per minute-RRB- to extremely fast blast beat tempos -LRB-quarter note = 350 beats per minute-RRB-. -LSB-edit-RSB- Harmony One of the signatures of the genre is the guitar power chord. In technical terms, the power chord is relatively simple: it involves just one main interval, generally the perfect fifth, though an octave may be added as a doubling of the root. Although the perfect fifth interval is the most common basis for the power chord, power chords are also based on different intervals such as the minor third, major third, perfect fourth, diminished fifth, or minor sixth. Most power chords are also played with a consistent finger arrangement that can be slid easily up and down the fretboard. -LSB-edit-RSB- Typical harmonic structures Heavy metal is usually based on riffs created with three main harmonic traits: modal scale progressions, tritone and chromatic progressions, and the use of pedal points. Traditional heavy metal tends to employ modal scales, in particular the Aeolian and Phrygian modes. Harmonically speaking, this means the genre typically incorporates modal chord progressions such as the Aeolian progressions I-VI-VII, I-VII--LRB-VI-RRB-, or I-VI-IV-VII and Phrygian progressions implying the relation between I and ♭II -LRB-I-♭II-I, I-♭II-III, or I-♭II-VII for example-RRB-. Tense-sounding chromatic or tritone relationships are used in a number of metal chord progressions. The tritone, an interval spanning three whole tones--such as C and F#--was a forbidden dissonance in medieval ecclesiastical singing, which led monks to call it diabolus in musica--``the devil in music.'' Because of that original symbolic association, it came to be heard in Western cultural convention as ``evil''. Heavy metal has made extensive use of the tritone in guitar solos and riffs, such as in the beginning of ``Black Sabbath''. Heavy metal songs often make extensive use of pedal point as a harmonic basis. A pedal point is a sustained tone, typically in the bass range, during which at least one foreign -LRB-i.e., dissonant-RRB- harmony is sounded in the other parts. -LSB-edit-RSB- Relationship with classical music Robert Walser argues that, alongside blues and R&B, the ``assemblage of disparate musical styles known...as `classical music''' has been a major influence on heavy metal since the genre's earliest days. He claims that metal's ``most influential musicians have been guitar players who have also studied classical music. Their appropriation and adaptation of classical models sparked the development of a new kind of guitar virtuosity -LSB-and-RSB- changes in the harmonic and melodic language of heavy metal.'' The Grove Music Online states that the ``1980s brought on ...the widespread adaptation of chord progressions and virtuosic practices from 18th-century European models, especially Bach and Vivaldi, by influential guitarists such as Van Halen, Randy Rhoads and Yngwie Malmsteen''. Although a number of metal musicians cite classical composers as inspiration, classical and metal are rooted in different cultural traditions and practices--classical in the art music tradition, metal in the popular music tradition. As musicologists Nicolas Cook and Nicola Dibben note, ``Analyses of popular music also sometimes reveal the influence of `art traditions.' An example is Walser's linkage of heavy metal music with the ideologies and even some of the performance practices of nineteenth-century Romanticism. However, it would be clearly wrong to claim that traditions such as blues, rock, heavy metal, rap or dance music derive primarily from `art music.''' -LSB-edit-RSB- Lyrical themes Black Sabbath and the many metal bands they inspired have concentrated lyrically ``on dark and depressing subject matter to an extent hitherto unprecedented in any form of pop music,'' according to scholars David Hatch and Stephen Millward. They take as an example Sabbath's 1970 album Paranoid, which ``included songs dealing with personal trauma--`Paranoid' and `Fairies Wear Boots' -LRB-which described the unsavoury side effects of drug-taking-RRB---as well as those confronting wider issues, such as the self-explanatory `War Pigs' and `Hand of Doom.''' Nuclear annihilation was addressed in later metal songs such as Iron Maiden's ``2 Minutes to Midnight'' and Ozzy Osbourne's ``Killer of Giants''. Death is a predominant theme in heavy metal, routinely featuring in the lyrics of bands as otherwise widely different as Slayer and W.A.S.P.. The more extreme forms of death metal and grindcore tend to have aggressive and gory lyrics. Deriving from the genre's roots in blues music, sex is another important topic--a thread running from Led Zeppelin's suggestive lyrics to the more explicit references of glam and nu metal bands. Romantic tragedy is a standard theme of gothic and doom metal, as well as of nu metal, where teenage angst is another central topic. Heavy metal songs often feature outlandish, fantasy-inspired lyrics, lending them an escapist quality. Iron Maiden's songs, for instance, were frequently inspired by mythology, fiction, and poetry, such as Iron Maiden's ``Rime of the Ancient Mariner,'' based on the Samuel Taylor Coleridge poem. Led Zeppelin lyrics often reference Lord of the Rings as well as other mythology and folklore, such as in the songs ``The Battle of Evermore'', ``Immigrant Song'', ``Ramble On'', ``No Quarter'', and ``Achilles Last Stand''. Other examples include Black Sabbath's ``The Wizard,'' Megadeth's ``The Conjuring'' and ``Five Magics,'' and Judas Priest's ``Dreamer Deceiver''. Since the 1980s, with the rise of thrash metal and songs such as Metallica's ''...And Justice for All'' and Megadeth's ``Peace Sells'', more metal lyrics have included sociopolitical commentary. Genres such as melodic death metal, progressive metal, and black metal often explore philosophical themes. The thematic content of heavy metal has long been a target of criticism. According to Jon Pareles, ``Heavy metal's main subject matter is simple and virtually universal. With grunts, moans and subliterary lyrics, it celebrates...a party without limits... -LSB-T-RSB-he bulk of the music is stylized and formulaic.'' Music critics have often deemed metal lyrics juvenile and banal, and others have objected to what they see as advocacy of misogyny and the occult. During the 1980s, the Parents Music Resource Center petitioned the U.S. Congress to regulate the popular music industry due to what the group asserted were objectionable lyrics, particularly those in heavy metal songs. In 1990, Judas Priest was sued in American court by the parents of two young men who had shot themselves five years earlier, allegedly after hearing the subliminal statement ``do it'' in a Priest song. While the case attracted a great deal of media attention, it was ultimately dismissed. In some predominantly Muslim countries, heavy metal has been officially denounced as a threat to traditional values. In countries including Morocco, Egypt, Lebanon, and Malaysia, there have been incidents of heavy metal musicians and fans being arrested and incarcerated. -LSB-edit-RSB- Image and fashion As with much popular music, visual imagery plays a large role in heavy metal. In addition to its sound and lyrics, a heavy metal band's ``image'' is expressed in album sleeve art, logos, stage sets, clothing, and music videos. Some heavy metal acts such as Alice Cooper, Kiss, and Gwar have become known as much for their outrageous performance personas and stage shows as for their music. Down-the-back long hair, according to Weinstein, is the ``most crucial distinguishing feature of metal fashion.'' Originally adopted from the hippie subculture, by the 1980s and 1990s heavy metal hair ``symbolised the hate, angst and disenchantment of a generation that seemingly never felt at home,'' according to journalist Nader Rahman. Long hair gave members of the metal community ``the power they needed to rebel against nothing in general.'' The classic uniform of heavy metal fans consists of ``blue jeans, black T-shirts, boots and black leather or jeans jackets.... T-shirts are generally emblazoned with the logos or other visual representations of favorite metal bands.'' Metal fans also ``appropriated elements from the S&M community -LRB-chains, metal studs, skulls, leather and crosses-RRB-.'' In the 1980s, a range of sources, from punk and goth music to horror films, influenced metal fashion. Many metal performers of the 1970s and 1980s used radically shaped and brightly colored instruments to enhance their stage appearance. Fashion and personal style was especially important for glam metal bands of the era. Performers typically wore long, dyed, hairspray-teased hair -LRB-hence the nickname, ``hair metal''-RRB-; makeup such as lipstick and eyeliner; gaudy clothing, including leopard-skin-printed shirts or vests and tight denim, leather, or spandex pants; and accessories such as headbands and jewelry. Pioneered by the heavy metal act X Japan in the late 1980s, bands in the Japanese movement known as visual kei--which includes many nonmetal groups--emphasize elaborate costumes, hair, and makeup. -LSB-edit-RSB- Physical gestures Many metal musicians when performing live engage in headbanging, which involves rhythmically beating time with the head, often emphasized by long hair. The corna, or devil horns, hand gesture, also widespread, was popularized by vocalist Ronnie James Dio while with Black Sabbath and Dio. Gene Simmons of Kiss claims to have been the first to make the gesture in concert. Attendees of metal concerts do not dance in the usual sense; Deena Weinstein has argued that this is due to the music's largely male audience and ``extreme heterosexualist ideology.'' She identifies two primary body movements that substitute for dancing: headbanging and an arm thrust that is both a sign of appreciation and a rhythmic gesture. The performance of air guitar is popular among metal fans both at concerts and listening to records at home. Other concert audience activities include stage diving, crowd surfing, pushing and shoving in a chaotic mêlée called moshing, and displaying the corna hand symbol. -LSB-edit-RSB- Fan subculture Deena Weinstein argues that heavy metal has outlasted many other rock genres largely due to the emergence of an intense, exclusionary, strongly masculine subculture. While the metal fanbase is largely young, white, male, and blue-collar, the group is ``tolerant of those outside its core demographic base who follow its codes of dress, appearance, and behavior.'' Identification with the subculture is strengthened not only by the shared experience of concert-going and shared elements of fashion, but also by contributing to metal magazines and, more recently, websites. The metal scene has been characterized as a ``subculture of alienation'', with its own code of authenticity. This code puts several demands on performers: they must appear both completely devoted to their music and loyal to the subculture that supports it; they must appear disinterested in mainstream appeal and radio hits; and they must never ``sell out''. For the fans themselves, the code promotes ``opposition to established authority, and separateness from the rest of society.'' Scholars of metal have noted the tendency of fans to classify and reject some performers -LRB-and some other fans-RRB- as ``posers'' ``who pretended to be part of the subculture, but who were deemed to lack authenticity and sincerity.'' -LSB-edit-RSB- Etymology The origin of the term heavy metal in a musical context is uncertain. The phrase has been used for centuries in chemistry and metallurgy. An early use of the term in modern popular culture was by countercultural writer William S. Burroughs. His 1962 novel The Soft Machine includes a character known as ``Uranian Willy, the Heavy Metal Kid.'' Burroughs's next novel, Nova Express -LRB-1964-RRB-, develops the theme, using heavy metal as a metaphor for addictive drugs: ``With their diseases and orgasm drugs and their sexless parasite life forms--Heavy Metal People of Uranus wrapped in cool blue mist of vaporized bank notes--And The Insect People of Minraud with metal music.'' Metal historian Ian Christe describes what the components of the term mean in ``hippiespeak'': ``heavy'' is roughly synonymous with ``potent'' or ``profound,'' and ``metal'' designates a certain type of mood, grinding and weighted as with metal. The word ``heavy'' in this sense was a basic element of beatnik and later countercultural slang, and references to ``heavy music''--typically slower, more amplified variations of standard pop fare--were already common by the mid-1960s. Iron Butterfly's debut album, released in early 1968, was titled Heavy. The first recorded use of heavy metal is a reference to a motorcycle in the Steppenwolf song ``Born to Be Wild,'' also released that year: ``I like smoke and lightning/Heavy metal thunder/Racin' with the wind/And the feelin' that I'm under.'' A late, and disputed, claim about the source of the term was made by ``Chas'' Chandler, former manager of the Jimi Hendrix Experience. In a 1995 interview on the PBS program Rock and Roll, he asserted that heavy metal ``was a term originated in a New York Times article reviewing a Jimi Hendrix performance,'' in which the author likened the event to ``listening to heavy metal falling from the sky.'' A source for Chandler's claim has never been found. The first documented use of the phrase to describe a type of rock music identified to date appears in a review by Barry Gifford. In the May 11, 1968, issue of Rolling Stone, he wrote about the album A Long Time Comin' by U.S. band Electric Flag: ``Nobody who's been listening to Mike Bloomfield--either talking or playing--in the last few years could have expected this. This is the new soul music, the synthesis of white blues and heavy metal rock.'' Other early documented uses of the phrase are from reviews by critic Mike Saunders. In the November 12, 1970, issue of Rolling Stone, he commented on an album put out the previous year by the British band Humble Pie: ``Safe As Yesterday Is, their first American release, proved that Humble Pie could be boring in lots of different ways. Here they were a noisy, unmelodic, heavy metal-leaden shit-rock band with the loud and noisy parts beyond doubt. There were a couple of nice songs...and one monumental pile of refuse.'' He described the band's latest, self-titled release as ``more of the same 27th-rate heavy metal crap.'' In a review of Sir Lord Baltimore's Kingdom Come in the May 1971 Creem, Saunders wrote, ``Sir Lord Baltimore seems to have down pat most all the best heavy metal tricks in the book.'' Creem critic Lester Bangs is credited with popularizing the term via his early 1970s essays on bands such as Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. Through the decade, heavy metal was used by certain critics as a virtually automatic putdown. In 1979, lead New York Times popular music critic John Rockwell described what he called ``heavy-metal rock'' as ``brutally aggressive music played mostly for minds clouded by drugs,'' and, in a different article, as ``a crude exaggeration of rock basics that appeals to white teenagers.'' Coined by Black Sabbath drummer, Bill Ward, ``downer rock'' was one of the earliest terms used to describe this style of music and was applied to such acts as Sabbath and Bloodrock. Classic Rock magazine described the downer rock culture revolving around the use of Quaaludes and the drinking of wine. Later the term would be replaced by ``heavy metal.'' The terms ``heavy metal'' and ``hard rock'' have often been used interchangeably, particularly in discussing bands of the 1970s, a period when the terms were largely synonymous. For example, the 1983 Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll includes this passage: ``known for its aggressive blues-based hard-rock style, Aerosmith was the top American heavy-metal band of the mid-Seventies.'' -LSB-edit-RSB- History -LSB-edit-RSB- Antecedents: mid-1960s While heavy metal's quintessential guitar style, built around distortion-heavy riffs and power chords, traces its roots to the late 1950s instrumentals of American Link Wray, the genre's direct lineage begins in the mid-1960s. American blues music was a major influence on the early British rockers of the era. Bands like The Rolling Stones and The Yardbirds developed blues-rock by recording covers of many classic blues songs, often speeding up the tempos. As they experimented with the music, the UK blues-based bands--and the U.S. acts they influenced in turn--developed what would become the hallmarks of heavy metal, in particular, the loud, distorted guitar sound. The Kinks played a major role in popularizing this sound with their 1964 hit ``You Really Got Me.'' A significant contributor to the emerging guitar sound was the feedback facilitated by the new generation of amplifiers. In addition to The Kinks' Dave Davies, other guitarists such as The Who's Pete Townshend and the Tridents' Jeff Beck were experimenting with feedback. Where the blues-rock drumming style started out largely as simple shuffle beats on small kits, drummers began using a more muscular, complex, and amplified approach to match and be heard against the increasingly loud guitar. Vocalists similarly modified their technique and increased their reliance on amplification, often becoming more stylized and dramatic. In terms of sheer volume, especially in live performance, The Who's ``bigger-louder-wall-of-Marshalls'' approach was seminal. Simultaneous advances in amplification and recording technology made it possible to successfully capture the power of this heavier approach on record. The combination of blues-rock with psychedelic rock formed much of the original basis for heavy metal. One of the most influential bands in forging the merger of genres was the British power trio Cream, who derived a massive, heavy sound from unison riffing between guitarist Eric Clapton and bassist Jack Bruce, as well as Ginger Baker's double bass drumming. Their first two LPs, Fresh Cream -LRB-1966-RRB- and Disraeli Gears -LRB-1967-RRB-, are regarded as essential prototypes for the future style. The Jimi Hendrix Experience's debut album, Are You Experienced -LRB-1967-RRB-, was also highly influential. Hendrix's virtuosic technique would be emulated by many metal guitarists and the album's most successful single, ``Purple Haze,'' is identified by some as the first heavy metal hit. Vanilla Fudge, whose first album also came out in 1967, have been called ``one of the few American links between psychedelia and what soon became heavy metal.'' -LSB-edit-RSB- Origins: late 1960s and early 1970s In 1968, the sound that would become known as heavy metal began to coalesce. That January, the San Francisco band Blue Cheer released a cover of Eddie Cochran's classic ``Summertime Blues,'' from their debut album Vincebus Eruptum, that many consider the first true heavy metal recording. The same month, Steppenwolf released its self-titled debut album, including ``Born to Be Wild,'' which refers to ``heavy metal'' in the lyrics. In July, another two epochal records came out: The Yardbirds' ``Think About It''--B-side of the band's last single--with a performance by guitarist Jimmy Page anticipating the metal sound he would soon make famous; and Iron Butterfly's In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida, with its 17-minute-long title track, a prime candidate for first-ever heavy metal album. In August, The Beatles' single version of ``Revolution,'' with its redlined guitar and drum sound, set new standards for distortion in a top-selling context. The Jeff Beck Group, whose leader had preceded Page as The Yardbirds' guitarist, released its debut record that same month: Truth featured some of the ``most molten, barbed, downright funny noises of all time,'' breaking ground for generations of metal ax-slingers. In October, Page's new band, Led Zeppelin, made its live debut. The Beatles' so-called White Album, which also came out that month, included ``Helter Skelter,'' then one of the heaviest-sounding songs ever released by a major band. The Pretty Things' rock opera S.F. Sorrow, released in December, featured ``proto heavy metal'' songs such as ``Old Man Going.'' In January 1969, Led Zeppelin's self-titled debut album was released and reached number 10 on the Billboard album chart. In July, Zeppelin and a power trio with a Cream-inspired, but cruder sound, Grand Funk Railroad, played the Atlanta Pop Festival. That same month, another Cream-rooted trio led by Leslie West released Mountain, an album filled with heavy blues-rock guitar and roaring vocals. In August, the group--now itself dubbed Mountain--played an hour-long set at the Woodstock Festival. Grand Funk's debut album, On Time, also came out that month. In the fall, Led Zeppelin II went to number 1 and the album's single ``Whole Lotta Love'' hit number 4 on the Billboard pop chart. The metal revolution was under way. Led Zeppelin defined central aspects of the emerging genre, with Page's highly distorted guitar style and singer Robert Plant's dramatic, wailing vocals. Other bands, with a more consistently heavy, ``purely'' metal sound, would prove equally important in codifying the genre. The 1970 releases by Black Sabbath -LRB-Black Sabbath and Paranoid-RRB- and Deep Purple -LRB-In Rock-RRB- were crucial in this regard. Black Sabbath had developed a particularly heavy sound in part due to an industrial accident guitarist Tony Iommi suffered before cofounding the band. Unable to play normally, Iommi had to tune his guitar down for easier fretting and rely on power chords with their relatively simple fingering. Deep Purple had fluctuated between styles in its early years, but by 1969 vocalist Ian Gillan and guitarist Ritchie Blackmore had led the band toward the developing heavy metal style. In 1970, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple scored major UK chart hits with ``Paranoid'' and ``Black Night,'' respectively. That same year, two other British bands released debut albums in a heavy metal mode: Uriah Heep with Very `eavy... Very `umble and UFO with UFO 1. Budgie brought the new metal sound into a power trio context. The occult lyrics and imagery employed by Black Sabbath and Uriah Heep would prove particularly influential; Led Zeppelin also began foregrounding such elements with its fourth album, released in 1971. On the other side of the Atlantic, the trend-setting group was Grand Funk Railroad, ``the most commercially successful American heavy-metal band from 1970 until they disbanded in 1976, -LSB-they-RSB- established the Seventies success formula: continuous touring.'' Other bands identified with metal emerged in the U.S., such as Dust -LRB-first LP in 1971-RRB-, Blue Öyster Cult -LRB-1972-RRB-, and Kiss -LRB-1974-RRB-. In Germany, the Scorpions debuted with Lonesome Crow in 1972. Blackmore, who had emerged as a virtuoso soloist with Deep Purple's Machine Head -LRB-1972-RRB-, quit the group in 1975 to form Rainbow. These bands also built audiences via constant touring and increasingly elaborate stage shows. As described above, there are arguments about whether these and other early bands truly qualify as ``heavy metal'' or simply as ``hard rock.'' Those closer to the music's blues roots or placing greater emphasis on melody are now commonly ascribed the latter label. AC/DC, which debuted with High Voltage in 1976, is a prime example. The 1983 Rolling Stone encyclopedia entry begins, ``Australian heavy-metal band AC/DC...'' Rock historian Clinton Walker writes, ``Calling AC/DC a heavy metal band in the seventies was as inaccurate as it is today... -LSB-They-RSB- were a rock 'n' roll band that just happened to be heavy enough for metal.'' The issue is not only one of shifting definitions, but also a persistent distinction between musical style and audience identification: Ian Christe describes how the band ``became the stepping-stone that led huge numbers of hard rock fans into heavy metal perdition.'' In certain cases, there is little debate. After Black Sabbath, the next major example is Britain's Judas Priest, which debuted with Rocka Rolla in 1974. In Christe's description, Black Sabbath's Though Judas Priest did not have a top 40 album in the U.S. until 1980, for many it was the definitive post-Sabbath heavy metal band; its twin-guitar attack, featuring rapid tempos and a nonbluesy, more cleanly metallic sound, was a major influence on later acts. While heavy metal was growing in popularity, most critics were not enamored of the music. Objections were raised to metal's adoption of visual spectacle and other trappings of commercial artifice, but the main offense was its perceived musical and lyrical vacuity: reviewing a Black Sabbath album in the early 1970s, leading critic Robert Christgau described it as ``dull and decadent...dim-witted, amoral exploitation.'' -LSB-edit-RSB- Mainstream: late 1970s and 1980s Punk rock emerged in the mid-1970s as a reaction against contemporary social conditions as well as what was perceived as the overindulgent, overproduced rock music of the time, including heavy metal. Sales of heavy metal records declined sharply in the late 1970s in the face of punk, disco, and more mainstream rock. With the major labels fixated on punk, many newer British heavy metal bands were inspired by the movement's aggressive, high-energy sound and ``lo-fi'', do it yourself ethos. Underground metal bands began putting out cheaply recorded releases independently to small, devoted audiences. Motörhead, founded in 1975, was the first important band to straddle the punk/metal divide. With the explosion of punk in 1977, others followed. British music papers such as the NME and Sounds took notice, with Sounds writer Geoff Barton christening the movement the ``New Wave of British Heavy Metal.'' NWOBHM bands including Iron Maiden, Saxon, and Def Leppard reenergized the heavy metal genre. Following the lead set by Judas Priest and Motörhead, they toughened up the sound, reduced its blues elements, and emphasized increasingly fast tempos. In 1980, NWOBHM broke into the mainstream, as albums by Iron Maiden and Saxon, as well as Motörhead, reached the British top 10. Though less commercially successful, other NWOBHM bands such as Venom and Diamond Head would have a significant influence on metal's development. In 1981, Motörhead became the first of this new breed of metal bands to top the UK charts with No Sleep 'til Hammersmith. The first generation of metal bands was ceding the limelight. Deep Purple had broken up soon after Blackmore's departure in 1975, and Led Zeppelin broke up following drummer John Bonham's death in 1980. Black Sabbath was routinely upstaged in concert by its opening act, the Los Angeles band Van Halen. Eddie Van Halen established himself as one of the leading metal guitar virtuosos of the era--his solo on ``Eruption,'' from the band's self-titled 1978 album, is considered a milestone. Randy Rhoads and Yngwie Malmsteen also became famed virtuosos, associated with what would be known as the neoclassical metal style. The adoption of classical elements had been spearheaded by Blackmore and the Scorpions' Uli Jon Roth; this next generation progressed to occasionally using classical nylon-stringed guitars, as Rhoads does on ``Dee'' from former Sabbath lead singer Ozzy Osbourne's first solo album, Blizzard of Ozz -LRB-1980-RRB-. Inspired by Van Halen's success, a metal scene began to develop in Southern California during the late 1970s. Based on the clubs of L.A.'s Sunset Strip, bands such as Quiet Riot, Ratt, Mötley Crüe, and W.A.S.P. were influenced by traditional heavy metal of the earlier 1970s and incorporated the theatrics -LRB-and sometimes makeup-RRB- of glam rock acts such as Alice Cooper and Kiss. The lyrics of these glam metal bands characteristically emphasized hedonism and wild behavior. Musically, the style was distinguished by rapid-fire shred guitar solos, anthemic choruses, and a relatively pop-oriented melodic approach. The glam metal movement--along with similarly styled acts such as New York's Twisted Sister--became a major force in metal and the wider spectrum of rock music. In the wake of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal and Judas Priest's breakthrough British Steel -LRB-1980-RRB-, heavy metal became increasingly popular in the early 1980s. Many metal artists benefited from the exposure they received on MTV, which began airing in 1981--sales often soared if a band's videos screened on the channel. Def Leppard's videos for Pyromania -LRB-1983-RRB- made them superstars in America and Quiet Riot became the first domestic heavy metal band to top the Billboard chart with Metal Health -LRB-1983-RRB-. One of the seminal events in metal's growing popularity was the 1983 US Festival in California, where the ``heavy metal day'' featuring Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen, Scorpions, Mötley Crüe, Judas Priest, and others drew the largest audiences of the three-day event. Between 1983 and 1984, heavy metal went from an 8 percent to a 20 percent share of all recordings sold in the U.S. Several major professional magazines devoted to the genre were launched, including Kerrang! -LRB-in 1981-RRB- and Metal Hammer -LRB-in 1984-RRB-, as well as a host of fan journals. In 1985, Billboard declared, ``Metal has broadened its audience base. Metal music is no longer the exclusive domain of male teenagers. The metal audience has become older -LRB-college-aged-RRB-, younger -LRB-pre-teen-RRB-, and more female.'' By the mid-1980s, glam metal was a dominant presence on the U.S. charts, music television, and the arena concert circuit. New bands such as L.A.'s Warrant and acts from the East Coast like Poison and Cinderella became major draws, while Mötley Crüe and Ratt remained very popular. Bridging the stylistic gap between hard rock and glam metal, New Jersey's Bon Jovi became enormously successful with its third album, Slippery When Wet -LRB-1986-RRB-. The similarly styled Swedish band Europe became international stars with the The Final Countdown -LRB-1986-RRB-. Its title track hit number 1 in 25 countries. In 1987, MTV launched a show, Headbanger's Ball, devoted exclusively to heavy metal videos. However, the metal audience had begun to factionalize, with those in many underground metal scenes favoring more extreme sounds and disparaging the popular style as ``lite metal'' or ``hair metal.'' One band that reached diverse audiences was Guns N' Roses. In contrast to their glam metal contemporaries in L.A., they were seen as much rawer and more dangerous. With the release of their chart-topping Appetite for Destruction -LRB-1987-RRB-, they ``recharged and almost single-handedly sustained the Sunset Strip sleaze system for several years.'' The following year, Jane's Addiction emerged from the same L.A. hard-rock club scene with its major label debut, Nothing's Shocking. Reviewing the album, Rolling Stone declared, ``as much as any band in existence, Jane's Addiction is the true heir to Led Zeppelin.'' The group was one of the first to be identified with the ``alternative metal'' trend that would come to the fore in the next decade. Meanwhile, new bands such as New York's Winger and New Jersey's Skid Row sustained the popularity of the glam metal style. -LSB-edit-RSB- Underground metal: 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s Many subgenres of heavy metal developed outside of the commercial mainstream during the 1980s. Several attempts have been made to map the complex world of underground metal, most notably by the editors of Allmusic, as well as critic Garry Sharpe-Young. Sharpe-Young's multivolume metal encyclopedia separates the underground into five major categories: thrash metal, death metal, black metal, power metal, and the related subgenres of doom and gothic metal. -LSB-edit-RSB- Thrash metal Thrash metal emerged in the early 1980s under the influence of hardcore punk and the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, particularly songs in the revved-up style known as speed metal. The movement began in the United States, with Bay Area thrash metal being the leading scene. The sound developed by thrash groups was faster and more aggressive than that of the original metal bands and their glam metal successors. Low-register guitar riffs are typically overlaid with shredding leads. Lyrics often express nihilistic views or deal with social issues using visceral, gory language. Thrash has been described as a form of ``urban blight music'' and ``a palefaced cousin of rap.'' The subgenre was popularized by the ``Big Four of Thrash'': Metallica, Anthrax, Megadeth, and Slayer. Three German bands, Kreator, Sodom, and Destruction, played a central role in bringing the style to Europe. Others, including San Francisco Bay Area's Testament and Exodus, New Jersey's Overkill, and Brazil's Sepultura, also had a significant impact. While thrash began as an underground scene, and remained largely that for almost a decade, the leading bands in the movement began to reach a wider audience. Metallica brought the sound into the top 40 of the Billboard album chart in 1986 with Master of Puppets; two years later, the band's ...And Justice for All hit number 6, while Megadeth and Anthrax had top 40 records. Though less commercially successful than the rest of the Big Four, Slayer released one of the genre's definitive records: Reign in Blood -LRB-1986-RRB- was described by Kerrang! as the ``heaviest album of all time.'' Two decades later, Metal Hammer named it the best album of the preceding twenty years. Slayer attracted a following among far-right skinheads, and accusations of promoting violence and Nazi themes have dogged the band. In the early 1990s, thrash achieved breakout success, challenging and redefining the metal mainstream. Metallica's self-titled 1991 album topped the Billboard chart , Megadeth's Countdown to Extinction -LRB-1992-RRB- hit number 2 , Anthrax and Slayer cracked the top 10 , and albums by regional bands such as Testament and Sepultura entered the top 100. -LSB-edit-RSB- Death metal Thrash soon began to evolve and split into more extreme metal genres. ``Slayer's music was directly responsible for the rise of death metal,'' according to MTV News. The NWOBHM band Venom was also an important progenitor. The death metal movement in both North America and Europe adopted and emphasized the elements of blasphemy and diabolism employed by such acts. Florida's Death and the Bay Area's Possessed are recognized as seminal bands in the style. Both groups have been credited with inspiring the subgenre's name, the latter via its 1984 demo Death Metal and the song ``Death Metal,'' from its 1985 debut album Seven Churches -LRB-1985-RRB-. Death metal utilizes the speed and aggression of both thrash and hardcore, fused with lyrics preoccupied with Z-grade slasher movie violence and Satanism. Death metal vocals are typically bleak, involving guttural ``death growls,'' high-pitched screaming, the ``death rasp,'' and other uncommon techniques. Complementing the deep, aggressive vocal style are downtuned, highly distorted guitars and extremely fast percussion, often with rapid double bass drumming and ``wall of sound''--style blast beats. Frequent tempo and time signature changes and syncopation are also typical. Death metal, like thrash metal, generally rejects the theatrics of earlier metal styles, opting instead for an everyday look of ripped jeans and plain leather jackets. One major exception to this rule was Deicide's Glen Benton, who branded an inverted cross on his forehead and wore armor on stage. Morbid Angel adopted neo-fascist imagery. These two bands, along with Death and Obituary, were leaders of the major death metal scene that emerged in Florida in the mid-1980s. In the UK, the related style of grindcore, led by bands such as Napalm Death and Extreme Noise Terror, emerged out of the anarcho-punk movement. A large Scandinavian death metal scene, with bands such as Sweden's Entombed and Dismember, began to develop as well. Out of this evolved a melodic death metal sound, typified by Swedish bands such as In Flames and Dark Tranquillity and Finland's Children of Bodom and Kalmah. -LSB-citation needed-RSB- -LSB-edit-RSB- Black metal The first wave of black metal emerged in Europe in the early and mid-1980s, led by Britain's Venom, Denmark's Mercyful Fate, Switzerland's Hellhammer and Celtic Frost, and Sweden's Bathory. By the late 1980s, Norwegian bands such as Mayhem and Burzum were heading a second wave. Black metal varies considerably in style and production quality, although most bands emphasize shrieked and growled vocals, highly distorted guitars frequently played with rapid tremolo picking, a ``dark'' atmosphere and intentionally lo-fi production, with ambient noise and background hiss. Satanic themes are common in black metal, though many bands take inspiration from ancient paganism, promoting a return to pre-Christian values. Numerous black metal bands also ``experiment with sounds from all possible forms of metal, folk, classical music, electronica and avant-garde.'' Darkthrone drummer Fenriz explains, ``It had something to do with production, lyrics, the way they dressed and a commitment to making ugly, raw, grim stuff. There wasn't a generic sound.'' By 1990, Mayhem was regularly wearing corpsepaint; many other black metal acts also adopted the look. Bathory inspired the Viking metal and folk metal movements and Immortal brought blast beats to the fore. Some bands in the Scandinavian black metal scene became associated with considerable violence in the early 1990s, with Mayhem and Burzum linked to church burnings. Growing commercial hype around death metal generated a backlash; beginning in Norway, much of the Scandinavian metal underground shifted to support a black metal scene that resisted being co-opted by the commercial metal industry. According to former Gorgoroth vocalist Gaahl, ``Black Metal was never meant to reach an audience... -LSB-We-RSB- had a common enemy which was, of course, Christianity, socialism and everything that democracy stands for.'' By 1992, black metal scenes had begun to emerge in areas outside Scandinavia, including Germany, France, and Poland. The 1993 murder of Mayhem's Euronymous by Burzum's Varg Vikernes provoked intensive media coverage. Around 1996, when many in the scene felt the genre was stagnating, several key bands, including Burzum and Finland's Beherit, moved toward an ambient style, while symphonic black metal was explored by Sweden's Tiamat and Switzerland's Samael. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Norway's Dimmu Borgir brought black metal closer to the mainstream, as did Cradle of Filth, which Metal Hammer calls England's most successful metal band since Iron Maiden. -LSB-edit-RSB- Power metal During the late 1980s, the power metal scene came together largely in reaction to the harshness of death and black metal. Though a relatively underground style in North America, it enjoys wide popularity in Europe, Japan, and South America. Power metal focuses on upbeat, epic melodies and themes that ``appeal to the listener's sense of valor and loveliness.'' The prototype for the sound was established in the mid- to late 1980s by Germany's Helloween, which combined the power riffs, melodic approach, and high-pitched, ``clean'' singing style of bands like Judas Priest and Iron Maiden with thrash's speed and energy, ``crystalliz-LSB-ing-RSB- the sonic ingredients of what is now known as power metal.'' Traditional power metal bands like Sweden's HammerFall, England's DragonForce, and Florida's Iced Earth have a sound clearly indebted to the classic NWOBHM style. Many power metal bands such as Florida's Kamelot, Finland's Nightwish, Italy's Rhapsody of Fire, and Russia's Catharsis feature a keyboard-based ``symphonic'' sound, sometimes employing orchestras and opera singers. Power metal has built a strong fanbase in Japan and South America, where bands like Brazil's Angra and Argentina's Rata Blanca are popular. Closely related to power metal is progressive metal, which adopts the complex compositional approach of bands like Rush and King Crimson. This style emerged in the United States in the early and mid-1980s, with innovators such as Queensrÿche, Fates Warning, and Dream Theater. The mix of the progressive and power metal sounds is typified by New Jersey's Symphony X, whose guitarist Michael Romeo is among the most recognized of latter-day shredders. -LSB-edit-RSB- Doom and gothic metal Emerging in the mid-1980s with such bands as California's Saint Vitus, Maryland's The Obsessed, Chicago's Trouble, and Sweden's Candlemass, the doom metal movement rejected other metal styles' emphasis on speed, slowing its music to a crawl. Doom metal traces its roots to the lyrical themes and musical approach of early Black Sabbath and Sabbath contemporaries such as Blue Cheer, Pentagram, and Black Widow. The Melvins have also been a significant influence on doom metal and a number of its subgenres. Doom emphasizes melody, melancholy tempos, and a sepulchral mood relative to many other varieties of metal. The 1991 release of Forest of Equilibrium, the debut album by UK band Cathedral, helped spark a new wave of doom metal. During the same period, the doom-death fusion style of British bands Paradise Lost, My Dying Bride, and Anathema gave rise to European gothic metal, with its signature dual-vocalist arrangements, exemplified by Norway's Theatre of Tragedy and Tristania. New York's Type O Negative introduced an American take on the style. In the United States, sludge metal, mixing doom and hardcore, emerged in the late 1980s--Eyehategod and Crowbar were leaders in a major Louisiana sludge scene. Early in the next decade, California's Kyuss and Sleep, inspired by the earlier doom metal bands, spearheaded the rise of stoner metal, while Seattle's Earth helped develop the drone metal subgenre. The late 1990s saw new bands form such as the Los Angeles--based Goatsnake, with a classic stoner/doom sound, and Sunn O-RRB--RRB--RRB-, which crosses lines between doom, drone, and dark ambient metal--the New York Times has compared their sound to an ``Indian raga in the middle of an earthquake''. -LSB-edit-RSB- New fusions: 1990s and early 2000s The era of metal's mainstream dominance in North America came to an end in the early 1990s with the emergence of Nirvana and other grunge bands, signaling the popular breakthrough of alternative rock. Grunge acts were influenced by the heavy metal sound, but rejected the excesses of the more popular metal bands, such as their ``flashy and virtuosic solos'' and ``appearance-driven'' MTV orientation. Glam metal fell out of favor due not only to the success of grunge, but also because of the growing popularity of the more aggressive sound typified by Metallica and the post-thrash groove metal of Pantera and White Zombie. A few new, unambiguously metal bands had commercial success during the first half of the decade--Pantera's Far Beyond Driven topped the Billboard chart in 1994--but, ``In the dull eyes of the mainstream, metal was dead.'' Some bands tried to adapt to the new musical landscape. Metallica revamped its image: the band members cut their hair and, in 1996, headlined the alternative musical festival Lollapalooza founded by Jane's Addiction singer Perry Farrell. While this prompted a backlash among some long-time fans, Metallica remained one of the most successful bands in the world into the new century. Like Jane's Addiction, many of the most popular early 1990s groups with roots in heavy metal fall under the umbrella term ``alternative metal.'' Bands in Seattle's grunge scene such as Soundgarden, credited as making a ``place for heavy metal in alternative rock'', and Alice in Chains were at the center of the alternative metal movement. The label was applied to a wide spectrum of other acts that fused metal with different styles: Faith No More combined their alternative rock sound with punk, funk, metal, and hip hop; Primus joined elements of funk, punk, thrash metal, and experimental music; Tool mixed metal and progressive rock; bands such as Fear Factory and Ministry began incorporating metal into their industrial sound, and vice versa, respectively; and Marilyn Manson went down a similar route, while also employing shock effects of the sort popularized by Alice Cooper. Alternative metal artists, though they did not represent a cohesive scene, were united by their willingness to experiment with the metal genre and their rejection of glam metal aesthetics -LRB-with the stagecraft of Marilyn Manson and White Zombie--also identified with alt-metal--significant, if partial, exceptions-RRB-. Alternative metal's mix of styles and sounds represented ``the colorful results of metal opening up to face the outside world.'' In the mid- and late 1990s came a new wave of U.S. metal groups inspired by the alternative metal bands and their mix of genres. Dubbed ``nu metal'', bands such as P.O.D., Korn, Papa Roach, Limp Bizkit, Slipknot, and Linkin Park incorporated elements ranging from death metal to hip hop, often including DJs and rap-style vocals. The mix demonstrated that ``pancultural metal could pay off.'' Nu metal gained mainstream success through MTV rotation and Ozzy Osbourne's 1996 introduction of Ozzfest, which led the media to talk of a resurgence of heavy metal. In 1999, Billboard noted that there were more than 500 specialty metal radio shows in the U.S., nearly three times as many as ten years before. While nu metal was widely popular, traditional metal fans did not fully embrace the style. By early 2003, the movement's popularity was on the wane, though some bands associated with nu metal, such as System of a Down retained substantial followings. -LSB-edit-RSB- Recent trends: mid--late 2000s Metalcore, an originally American hybrid of thrash metal and hardcore punk, emerged as a commercial force in the mid-2000s. It is rooted in the crossover thrash style developed two decades earlier by bands such as Suicidal Tendencies, Dirty Rotten Imbeciles, and Stormtroopers of Death. Through the 1990s, metalcore was mostly an underground phenomenon. By 2004, melodic metalcore--influenced as well by melodic death metal--was popular enough that Killswitch Engage's The End of Heartache and Shadows Fall's The War Within debuted at numbers 21 and 20, respectively, on the Billboard album chart. Bullet for My Valentine, from Wales, broke into the top 5 in both the U.S. and British charts with Scream Aim Fire -LRB-2008-RRB-. In recent years, metalcore bands have received prominent slots at Ozzfest and the Download Festival. Lamb of God, with a related blend of metal styles, hit the Billboard top 10 in 2006 with Sacrament. The success of these bands and others such as Trivium, which has released both metalcore and straight-ahead thrash albums, and Mastodon, which plays in a progressive/sludge style, has inspired claims of a metal revival in the United States, dubbed by some critics the ``New Wave of American Heavy Metal.'' The term ``retro-metal'' has been applied to such bands as England's The Darkness and Australia's Wolfmother and Airbourne. The Darkness's Permission to Land -LRB-2003-RRB-, described as an ``eerily realistic simulation of '80s metal and '70s glam,'' topped the UK charts, going quintuple platinum. One Way Ticket to Hell... and Back -LRB-2005-RRB- reached number 11. Wolfmother's self-titled 2005 debut album had ``Deep Purple-ish organs,'' ``Jimmy Page-worthy chordal riffing,'' and lead singer Andrew Stockdale howling ``notes that Robert Plant can't reach anymore.'' ``Woman,'' a track from the album, won for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 2007 Grammy Awards. Slayer's ``Eyes of the Insane'' won for Best Metal Performance in 2007; their ``Final Six'' won the same award in 2008. Metallica took the honor in 2009 for ``My Apocalypse''. In continental Europe, especially Germany and Scandinavia, metal continues to be broadly popular. Well-established British acts such as Judas Priest and Iron Maiden continue to have chart success on the continent, as do a range of local groups. In Germany, Western Europe's largest music market, several continental metal bands placed multiple albums in the top 20 of the charts between 2003 and 2009, including the long-running German thrash metal band Kreator, Finnish melodic death metal act Children of Bodom, Norwegian symphonic extreme metal group Dimmu Borgir, and two power metal bands, Germany's Blind Guardian and Sweden's HammerFall. The Swedish melodic death metal act In Flames took both Come Clarity -LRB-2006-RRB- and A Sense of Purpose -LRB-2008-RRB- to number 6 in Germany; each album topped the Swedish charts. The label was applied to a wide spectrum of other acts that fused metal with different styles: Faith No More combined their alternative rock sound with punk, funk, metal, and hip hop; Primus joined elements of funk, punk, thrash metal, and experimental music; Tool mixed metal and progressive rock; bands such as Fear Factory and Ministry began incorporating metal into their industrial sound, and vice versa, respectively; and Marilyn Manson went down a similar route, while also employing shock effects of the sort popularized by Alice Cooper. Pioneered by the heavy metal act X Japan in the late 1980s, bands in the Japanese movement known as visual kei--which includes many nonmetal groups--emphasize elaborate costumes, hair, and makeup.

The remains of British Iron Age farms have been found at Chapel Lane, a site now protected as a public open space by the district and parish councils and supported by Navenby Archaeology Group. Significant Roman finds include parts of shops and houses that would have fronted onto Ermine Street, down which Roman armies marched to and from the Legionary Fortress at Lincoln. The city of Lincoln was very important at that time, probably the capital of the late Roman Province of Flavia Caesariensis. Evidence suggests that Navenby was a significant staging point along Ermine Street. The Romans are reported to have maintained a small base or garrison in the village, and a possible Romano-British temple and burial sites have been unearthed in the area. A 2009 archaeological dig uncovering a road, building foundations and Roman graves along with pottery and coins, showed Navenby to be a Roman Service Station. Cremations dated to the middle Saxon period have been discovered near the junction of High Dyke with Chapel Lane. Late Saxon remains have also been found under and around St Peter's Church, suggesting the original Roman village had moved from Ermine Street to Church Lane and North Lane by the late-Saxon period. Navenby's Saxon name is unknown. The present name is derived from the Old Norse Nafni+by, which means ``farmstead or village of a man called Nafni''. In the Domesday Book of 1086, Navenby appears as Navenbi and Navenebi. The Vikings exerted considerable influence over Lincolnshire in the 9th and 10th centuries, as can be seen in the many local place names ending in -by. The Viking Way, a 147-mile -LRB-237�km-RRB- footpath that cuts through the village, is a lasting reminder of their presence. -LSB-edit-RSB- Middle Ages Navenby, originally an agricultural village, became a market town after receiving a charter from Edward the Confessor in the 11th century. The charter was later renewed by William Rufus, Edward III and Richard II. The wide main street, down which farmers once drove their sheep to market, is lasting evidence of its market town status. A market square once stood at the centre, marked by a cross in honour of Queen Eleanor. Today, the square has gone and the cross is a ruin. Parish records exist for Navenby from 1681, although bishops' transcripts go back to 1562. The documents show the village hosted several annual fairs each year: a market fair on 17 October at which farm animals were traded; a feast on the Thursday before Easter; and a Hiring Fair held each May Day, at which servants gathered to seek employment. The records also show that part of the parish of Navenby was enclosed in 1772. Such was the significance of Navenby at this time that a workhouse for the parish poor was erected here, although the building was later given over to other uses. A Sick Society was founded in 1811 and a Parish School was built next to St Peter's Church in 1816, paid for by subscription. Following the 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act Navenby parish became part of the Lincoln Poor Law Union. -LSB-edit-RSB- 19th century When the market closed in the early 19th century Navenby lost its status as a market town, and once again became an agricultural village. The Penny Cyclopaedia of 1839, published by The Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, described the village in this way:  Many buildings were erected in Navenby during the 19th century, including a small Wesleyan Methodist chapel in about 1830, which was completely rebuilt in 1840. A Temperance Hall was built in 1852, later used as a second base by the Wesleyan Reformers. A Volunteer Fire Brigade was founded in 1844, comprising five men and a manual engine. The Provincial Gas Light and Coke Company began supplying gas lighting to the village in 1857, and in 1867 a railway station was built three-quarters of a mile -LRB-1.2�km-RRB- west of the village, on the Lincoln-to-Grantham branch of the Great Northern Railway. By 1871, the Dean and Chapter of Lincoln was the principal landowner and Lord of the Manor of Navenby. A witch bottle was discovered in the foundations of a Navenby farmhouse in 2005, thought to date back to about 1830. Containing pins, human hair and urine, the bottle was believed to protect a household against evil spells. -LSB-edit-RSB- Modern history Navenby was an agricultural village at the beginning of the 20th century, but the outbreak of the First World War brought changes for the community. A small airfield, Wellingore Heath, was opened on land bordering Navenby in 1917, to provide a base for the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service. The flat landscape, with its cliff-top situation, proved an ideal situation for flight operations. T. E. Lawrence, perhaps better known as Lawrence of Arabia, was stationed at nearby RAF Cranwell just after the war, in 1926, where he wrote a revised version of his Seven Pillars Of Wisdom. He mentioned Navenby in a letter to a friend at the time, saying: ``I'm too shy to go looking for dirt. That's why I can't go off stewing into the Lincoln or Navenby brothels with the fellows. They think it's because I'm superior: proud, or peculiar or `posh', as they say: and its because I wouldn't know what to do, how to carry myself, where to stop. Wellingore airfield closed after the war ended, but it was re-opened in 1935 and its facilities were expanded during the winter of 1939--40. By then known as RAF Wellingore, notable officers stationed there include Group Captain Douglas Bader and Wing Commander Guy Gibson -- both regular visitors to Navenby. The base served as a satellite field for RAF Digby until 1944 and as a relief landing ground for RAF Cranwell from April 1944 until its final closure in 1945, after which it was used as a camp for prisoners of war from Germany and Ukraine; the inmates were often made to work on the surrounding farmland. Navenby lost many men during the two World Wars. The village war memorial, a rough hewn stone Celtic Cross mounted on a plinth with a three-stepped base, is in the churchyard of St Peter's. It was manufactured by Messrs G Maile & Son Ltd at a cost of £200, and unveiled in April 1921. On it are inscribed the names of the 22�casualties from the First World War and the 8 from the Second World War. Following an initial decline in the population of Navenby at the turn of the 20th century, the post-war years saw numbers rise steeply. This increase can be directly linked to the 35-plus new houses built from the end of the Great War until the 1950s, as well as to other building projects from the 1970s onwards. Other post-war changes include the move away from a dependence on farming. Although Navenby continues to be surrounded by farms, it is now largely a dormitory village for Lincoln, Grantham and beyond. Figures from the 2001 census show that, out of a population of 1,666, almost 600 commute to work each day. -LSB-edit-RSB- Governance The parish of Navenby was originally in the higher division of the ancient Boothby Graffoe wapentake, in the North Kesteven division of the county of Lincolnshire. The term wapentake dates back to the Vikings and was used to describe a collection of local parishes. It originally meant ``show your weapon'' and the idea behind the term was that all those in favour of a resolution would raise their sword or axe to show agreement. The History of the County of Lincoln, a book written by Thomas Allen in 1834, states:  Navenby was classed as an ancient parish from the 11th to the 19th century, as it came ``under the jurisdiction of a clergyman'' and existed before 1597. Early records show that the Manor of Navenby was granted to the Dean and Chapter of Lincoln in 1292. The money generated by land rent was used by Roger de Newton, the first incumbent of the chantry chapel at Harby, Nottinghamshire, to maintain the building. This followed the death of Queen Eleanor, wife of Edward I, while on a visit to Lincoln. Eleanor died at de Newton's manor house at Harby in November 1290 and the chapel was erected in her honour. The parish began to take on civil as well as ecclesiastical duties following the 16th-century Dissolution of the Monasteries and the Tudor Poor Law Acts of 1601. The ecclesiastical parish of Navenby was originally placed in the Longoboby Rural Deanery, but was transferred to the Graffoe Rural Deanery in 1968, and it is still part of the Diocese of Lincoln. Navenby officially became a civil parish in the 19th century and became a member of the Lincoln Poor Law Union in 1834. The parish was also part of the Lincoln Rural Sanitary District. The Navenby civil parish boundaries were adjusted in 1931, to include the civil parish of nearby Skinnand. Following the Local Government Act 1888, Navenby was governed by Branston Rural District Council from 1894--1931. The village then came under the control of North Kesteven Rural District Council from 1931--1974, after the Local Government Act 1972 reformed the districts of Holland, Kesteven and much of Lindsey into the shire county of Lincolnshire. Today Navenby remains part of the North Kesteven district. Before the 1832 Reform Act, Lincolnshire sent twelve members to parliament, including two for the county, two for the city of Lincoln and two for the boroughs of Boston, Grantham, Great Grimsby and Stamford. As a result of the act, Lincolnshire's electoral divisions were amended, and Navenby became part of the South Division Parliamentary District for Lincolnshire. Two Whig candidates, Henry Handley and Gilbert John Heathcote, were returned in the first election. The village remained in the South Division until 1867, when it was transferred to the Mid Division. In 1885 it joined the North Kesteven Division, and in 1918 it became part of the Grantham Division, until 1974. Today, Navenby has its own parish council, dealing with issues such as play-area revamps and the protection of public open spaces. The council is based at High Street, Navenby. As of 2010, the chairman is Ken Gunning and the vice chairwoman is Margaret Lyon. The second tier of local government provided for Navenby is the Conservative-controlled North Kesteven District Council, which is responsible for housing problems and public health. The council is based at Kesteven Street, Sleaford. Navenby is also represented by two local councillors on the district council. Marianne Jane Overton, an Independent, and Michael David Wylie, a former Independent but now Conservative. They were elected in May 2007. Conservative-controlled Lincolnshire County Council provides the top tier of local government for Navenby, with responsibility for highways, sites of special interest and schools. It is based at the County Offices in Newland, Lincoln. Navenby has one representative on this council, Marianne Jane Overton, who also represents Branston ward. At government level, Navenby is represented by the Right Honorable Douglas Hogg QC, the Conservative MP for Sleaford and North Hykeham constituency. He is a former Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and his constituency head office is in Sleaford. Navenby comes under the East Midlands constituency for the European Parliament, which is represented by six politicians, including former Conservative turned Liberal Democrat Bill Newton Dunn. Newton Dunn lives in Navenby and his European responsibilities include Vice-Chairman of Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy Committee. In the 1980s, Newton Dunn coined the much-used phrase ``Democratic deficit''. -LSB-edit-RSB- Geography -LSB-edit-RSB- Topography The civil parish of Navenby straddles the old Roman Ermine Street, known locally as High Dyke. The road runs between the neighbouring villages of Boothby Graffoe and Wellingore and covers more than 2,100�acres -LRB-8.5�km2-RRB-. The Viking Way, a 147-mile -LRB-237�km-RRB- footpath between the Humber Bridge in North Lincolnshire and Oakham in Rutland, also passes through the village. Navenby is located at 53°06′36″N 0°31′26″W﻿ / ﻿53.11°N 0.52389°W﻿ / 53.11; -0.52389 and known as a Lincolnshire Cliff Village, as it is situated on a ridge of Jurassic limestone called the Lincoln Edge or Lincoln Cliff. The small cliff is one of only a few hills in Lincolnshire. Lying 8.7�miles -LRB-14�km-RRB- south of Lincoln and 8.9�miles -LRB-14.3�km-RRB- north-northwest of Sleaford, Navenby enjoys warm summers and dry frosty winters. During the Ice Age, most of the region surrounding Navenby was covered by ice sheets and this has influenced the topography and nature of the soils. Much of Lincolnshire is low-lying, in some places below sea level, but Navenby's cliff-top position means it is 226�ft -LRB-69�m-RRB- above sea level, giving it commanding views over the River Witham valley. The parish of Navenby is elongated in an east--west direction, extending east to the Lincoln Heath and west to the River Brant. The size of the parish has varied over the past two centuries. In 1821 it covered 2,110�acres -LRB-8.5�km2-RRB-; in 1951 it was 3,345�acres -LRB-13.54�km2-RRB-. -LSB-edit-RSB- Housing, streets and nearby places Although house prices have traditionally been lower than the national average in Navenby, they have risen quickly in recent years. In 2004, the average house price rose by 8.2% to £163,186, according to the Land Registry, while in 1999 the average was £60,000. The district surrounding Navenby -- North Kesteven -- remains a relatively inexpensive place to purchase property. Consequently, owner occupation is 77% -- which is higher than both the regional and national averages. However, the rising prices of recent years are resulting in housing becoming increasingly ``out of reach for those on average incomes''. A 2004 Housing Needs Study, carried out by Fordham Associates for North Kesteven District Council, highlighted the need for 460�``affordable homes'' to be built each year for the next five years in Navenby and the surrounding villages. Houses of specific interest in Navenby include Grade II listed Dial House in North Lane, which has a priest hole, and the Old Rectory in North Lane, which was built of Ashlar stone in 1859 by H A Darbyshire, a London architect. Several of Navenby's street names hint at its past. For example, the street now known as Clint Lane was formerly Watery Lane, apparently due to the number of springs that ran along it. The only ``watery'' part of Clint Lane today is a duck pond. The street includes a mix of 18th-century cottages, Victorian properties, Grade II listed farm buildings and 20th-century homes. Gas Lane, which is next to Clint Lane, was originally called Meg's Lane. It was re-named Gas Lane after The Provincial Gas Light and Coke Company set up a base there in 1857. The firm later became the Navenby and Wellingore Gas Light and Coke Company. Although the business has long since disappeared, the street name still survives. The street now known as Church Lane was originally Church Street. The road was named for the village church, St Peter's, which is located here, as is a former village school, now a private house. The school was built by subscription in 1816 and carries the inscription ``The Benefit Society 1821''. -LSB-edit-RSB- Climate According to the Köppen classification, the British Isles experience a maritime climate characterised by relatively cool summers and mild winters. Compared with other parts of the country, Lincolnshire -- and Navenby -- are slightly warmer and sunnier in the summer and colder and frostier in the winter. Owing to Navenby's inland position, far from the landfall of most Atlantic depressions, it is one of the driest places to live in the UK, receiving, on average, less than 3�ft -LRB-600�mm-RRB- of rain per year. The mean annual daily duration of bright sunshine is four hours and 12�minutes; the absence of any high ground is probably responsible for the area being one of the sunniest parts of the British Isles. -LSB-edit-RSB- Demography The United Kingdom Census 2001 found Navenby had 861 households and a population of 1,666, of which 792 were male and 874 female. This figure shows a population growth of more than 70% in the past 30�years, mainly due to on-going house-building projects. The 2001 census revealed there were only three second homes in the village, but that many villagers commuted each day to work. The great majority of properties are owner-occupied, with just over 100 rented from the council or private landlords. Most of the houses -LRB-over 500-RRB- are classified as detached, the average number of rooms per property is 6.03 and the average household size is 2.31. Ethnic diversity is minimal in Navenby. Statistics for 2001 show that of 707�households questioned, 703 were classed as white. Of those 707�households, 104 were pensioners living alone, 176 were couples without children, 27 were lone parents and 153�couples with dependent children. 343 of the households had at least one vehicle. Sickness rates were surprising high -- with 237�households reporting one or more people with limiting long-term illness. A total of 82% call themselves Christians. People aged between 25 and 44 represent the majority of Navenby residents, with 451 recorded in 2001. This is closely followed by people aged 45--64 -LRB-442-RRB- and children aged 5--15 -LRB-221-RRB-. Children aged under 4 -LRB-69-RRB- and people aged 16--24 -LRB-115-RRB- are in the minority. Almost 200�people -LRB-190-RRB- over the age of 75 were living in Navenby in 2001. The mean age of Navenby's population is 43.48 and the median age is 43.50. In 1851, 136�babies in every 1,000 died in their first year. This figure dropped to 107 per 1,000 in 1911 and three per 1,000 by 2001. The people of Navenby enjoy a high employment rate, although most work outside the village. Almost 600 commute each day, with the average journey to work being 12.5�miles -LRB-20.18�km-RRB-. The 2001 census revealed that of 1,186�people questioned aged 16--74, 722 were economically active, with men working an average of 44.79�hours each week and women an average of 31.23. The service industry was the largest sector of the local economy, employing 67% of all workers, compared to 1841 when 48% worked in agriculture. Manufacturing work was carried out by 178�people in 2001 and 565 were in the service industries. Of these workers, 371 were classed as managerial and professional. In 1841, just 16.6% of male workers had middle class jobs, but the 2001 census showed this figure had increased to 47.9%. Those with few or no qualifications numbered 597 in 2001, while 328 had higher diplomas, degrees or further degrees. In contrast, about 53% of children aged 5--14 went to school in 1851, but today 58% of those aged 16--17 stay on at school. -LSB-edit-RSB- Economy and media Navenby was originally an agricultural village, with most people living off the land or trading goods in the local market. Statistics show that, in 1841, 48% of villagers worked in agriculture, but today the majority of villagers, 67%, are employed in the service industry and most commute to work away from Navenby. The village does, however, offer some work opportunities, with the High Street lined with shops, fast-food stores and public houses. A doctors' surgery, a building society and a residential care home are in the village. Nearby Lincoln offers a wider variety of work, with its economy based mainly on public administration, commerce, arable farming and tourism. Over the past few years, Lincoln has also seen rapid development in its retail sector, in an attempt to compete with the neighbouring cities of Nottingham and Sheffield. The local newspaper for Navenby is the Lincolnshire Echo, which includes news and sports reports, as well as job advertisements. The local radio stations for the village are BBC Radio Lincolnshire on 94.9�FM and Lincs FM on 102.2�FM. The newest addition to the local airwaves is Siren FM, a community radio station that broadcasts on 107.3�FM from the University of Lincoln. -LSB-edit-RSB- Landmarks The centre of Navenby village is a designated conservation area; many of the stone- and brick-built houses date back hundreds of years. More than 20 of the properties, as well as the 1935 red telephone kiosk in High Street, have listed building status. -LSB-edit-RSB- Mrs Smith's Cottage Mrs Smith's Cottage is a mid-19th century Grade II listed building made from early Victorian red bricks. The range, the heart of the house, was in daily use for cooking and heating until the mid-1990s. The only access to the bedrooms is by a ladder. Electricity was installed in the 1930s, and the only other visible modern innovations are the coldwater tap -- installed to prevent the local council condemning the cottage in the late 1970s -- and an inside toilet. The original outside privy and washhouse can still be viewed. The cottage is named after its last resident, Mrs Hilda Smith, who lived there until 1995, when she was 102 years old. When Mrs Smith died, villagers mounted a campaign to ensure the cottage was kept as ``something special'' for Navenby. Today the cottage is run as a museum, having been granted official museum status in March 2000. It is open for much of the year and staffed by volunteers. The old pig sty and storage shed, deemed beyond repair, were demolished and the bricks used to construct a purpose-built visitor centre, used for exhibitions about Navenby and the local area. -LSB-edit-RSB- St Peter's Church The Grade I listed Anglican parish church in Navenby is dedicated to Saint Peter. Despite parish registers existing from 1681, and Bishop's transcripts that go back to 1562, it is difficult to date the building as it has a mishmash of styles, although its origins are probably 13th century. St Peter's is made up of three parts, including a mid-19th-century west tower, which replaced the original in 1859--60 after it fell down. The perpendicular clerestory is decorated with shields in quatrefoils and is lit with closely set three-light windows. The tall decorated chancel has very large windows. The side windows have reticulated tracery. The large east window was partly rebuilt in 1875--76, and is composed of six lights with two large mouchettes nodding to each other, as well as a very large reticulation unit. The sedilia and piscina are thought to date back to William de Herleston, who was rector of St Peter's from 1325--29. He was Edward I's chancellor and later became Canon of Llandaff. A founder's tomb, which is in a slightly different style, is probably that of his successor, John de Fenton, who was rector until 1832. The font is a lavish Victorian affair by Charles Kirk Junior, which was shown at the 1862 International Exhibition in London. The Pulpit is Jacobean and the Rood screen by Temple Moore dates from 1910. The Royal Arms are signed ``Thomas Hunton of Lincoln. There is a late 13th-century grave slab, with an inscription in Norman script which says ``Pray for Richard de Lue'' -LRB-Louth-RRB-. The church also contains an Easter Sepulchre. The carving is recognised as one of the finest in Lincolnshire, if not in the country, and receives a mention in virtually every book written on churches and their architecture. The churchyard is managed as a nature reserve. In 1982, church officials threatened to close St Peter's Church after being refused permission to sell silverware to pay for urgent repairs. The Archdeacon, the Venerable Michael Adie, ruled that such sales were against church policy, and that funds must be raised locally. -LSB-edit-RSB- Transport Navenby village lies at the eastern end of Navenby parish and is best accessed by road, as the A607 trunk road passes through the heart of the village. Navenby can also be reached from the A15 road, which runs past the end of Green Man Lane and links Lincoln with Sleaford. Editors of the website RoadGhosts.com claim this is one of the most haunted roads in Britain. Navenby once had its own railway station, built in 1867 as part of the Lincoln to Grantham branch of the Great Northern Railway. It fell victim, however, to the government's post-war railway closure programme, which was designed to modernise the service and return it to profitability. Some 3,318�miles -LRB-5,340�km-RRB- of railway were closed between 1948 and 1962 under this scheme, including Navenby station, which was shut in 1962. Today, the closest stations to Navenby are Lincoln, Sleaford, Grantham and Newark North Gate. Grantham and Newark are both part of the high-speed London to Scotland East Coast Main Line; Lincoln and Sleaford are branch line stations. Bus services to and from Navenby are limited. The main service is provided by the Stagecoach travel company, which runs the Number�1 service from Lincoln to Grantham, via Navenby, along the A607 every 30�minutes, from 7�am until 7�pm, every day except Sunday. There is only one bus on a Sunday. The same Number�1 service runs in the opposite direction too, from Grantham to Lincoln via Navenby, every 30�minutes each day except Sunday. Hodson's Coaches of Navenby runs an extra bus each Sunday to Lincoln. -LSB-edit-RSB- Education Navenby is served by its own village school, Navenby Church of England Primary School. It is a voluntary controlled school for children aged 4--11. There is a choice of nearby senior schools for older Navenby pupils, although none are within the village. Lincolnshire County Council operates a preference system for parents, which allows them to choose a preferred school, rather than one for which they are in the catchment area. The closest senior school to Navenby, and the one that is within the Designated Transport Area, is Sir William Robertson High School at Welbourn. This is a mixed comprehensive school named after Field Marshal William Robertson, who was born in Welbourn and served in the First World War. Other senior schools within a 10-mile -LRB-16�km-RRB- radius include Branston Community College, and two grammar schools in nearby Sleaford -- Carre's Grammar School for boys and Kesteven and Sleaford High School for girls. Private schools are available in Lincoln. Nearby Lincoln has two higher education institutions, the older being Bishop Grosseteste University College, which started life in 1862 as a teacher training college linked to the Anglican Church. During the 1990s, the college branched out into new subject areas with a focus on the arts and drama. The larger University of Lincoln began as the University of Lincolnshire and Humberside in 1996, when the University of Humberside opened a Lincoln campus next to Brayford Pool. Lincoln Art College and Riseholme Agricultural College, which had previously been part of De Montfort University in Leicester, were absorbed into the university in 2001. The university changed its name to the University of Lincoln in 2002. In the 2005/6 academic year, 8,292�full-time undergraduates were studying at the university. Many local senior schools offer sixth form tuition, and further education courses for students aged 16 and over are also provided by Lincoln College, which is the largest educational institution in Lincolnshire. It has 18,500�students, of whom 2,300 are full time. -LSB-edit-RSB- Culture and community Navenby used to be served by several public houses, but The Butcher's Arms and The Green Man Inn have long been converted into private houses. Now, just the King's Head and The Lion and Royal remain. The Grade II listed 18th-century King's Head is probably the oldest public house in the village; the nearby Lion and Royal dates from 1824 and is also Grade II listed. It was probably just called ``The Lion'' when it first opened, but added ``Royal'' to its name in honour of a special visitor. There is a large emblem over the front door, topped by the Prince of Wales's feathers, presented after the Prince -LRB-later Edward VII-RRB- stayed there, albeit briefly, in 1870. The former Green Man Inn, at the junction of Green Man Lane and the A15, was once a staging post for travellers and may have also been a court house. The Lincoln Club was established here in about 1741, catering for the ``distinguished gentlemen of Lincolnshire''. Sir Francis Dashwood, founder of the notorious Hellfire Club, was a member, as were Lord Monson of Burton and Lord Robert Manners of Bloxholm. Lincolnshire has a number of local dishes, including stuffed chine and haslet, and Navenby is home to several local food champions. Navenby baker Pete Welbourne was named as Great Britain's Baker of the Year in 2004, for his Lincolnshire Plum Bread recipe, and Odling Bros butchers' shop has enjoyed repeated success in an annual competition to find the best Lincolnshire pork sausages in the county. Local legend has it that Navenby is part of the Temple Bruer Pentagram. The pentagram includes the nearby villages of Temple Bruer -- which has strong connections with the Knights Templar of the 12th century -- as well as Wellingore and Harmston. It appears the sign is centred on the sewage works just west of Navenby. The pentagram is seen as having magical associations and is often said to have offered protection to witches. It also, however, has links with Christianity, Freemasonry and the Knights Templar, who used the pentagram symbol to represent ``infinity, connectiveness and oneness''. Although the A607 trunk road passes through Navenby, the village can also be accessed from the ``haunted'' A15, which runs past the end of Green Man Lane. According to local legend, a hanging tree once stood at the junction of the two roads, and those who died there still haunt the area. Scottish singer Barbara Dickson, OBE, briefly lived in Navenby in the 1970s. She went on to star in the Willy Russell musical Blood Brothers in 1982, as well as sing on the cast album recording of Chess, dueting with Elaine Paige. Another Navenby notable is Fenella Stoner, an artist who has exhibited at the Royal Academy and often paints pictures of the village and her garden. -LSB-edit-RSB- Public services Navenby's water is supplied by the Anglian Water company, and there is a sewage treatment works just west of the village. Healthcare is provided by the United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust, and a doctors' surgery operates in North Lane. The nearest NHS hospital is Lincoln County Hospital, Greetwell Road, Lincoln, which is 8.7�miles -LRB-14�km-RRB- north of Navenby. The second closest is Grantham and District Hospital, Manthorpe Rd, Grantham. The nearest dentists are also based in Lincoln or Grantham. The East Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Trust operates ambulances in the Navenby area, and the village is also covered by The Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire Air Ambulance, based at nearby Royal Air Force Waddington on the edge of Waddington village. Other emergency services are provided by Lincolnshire Fire and Rescue, whose nearest fire stations are in Lincoln and Grantham, and the Lincolnshire Police Force. The nearest police stations are in Lincoln, Sleaford and Grantham. -LSB-edit-RSB- Sport and clubs Navenby has a bowls club, Navenby Bowls Club, with approximately 50�members. The bowls season lasts from May to August and club members take part in three Bowls Leagues; Division�3 of the Cliff Bowls League, Section�C of the City Evening League and Division�3 of the Lincoln and District League. At least three evening matches are held each week during the season. Navenby also has several football teams for children, run under the title of Navenby Juniors FC. The teams play in the Under-12, Under-11, Under-10, Under-9 and Under-8 sections of the Grantham Youth Football League. The Under-10 team were the 2006--07 League Champions and the Under-11s were the Fair Play League Winners in 2006--07. Nearby Lincoln has a professional football team, Lincoln City F.C., nicknamed ``The Imps'', which plays at the Sincil Bank stadium. Navenby villager Tracey Duxbury is a member of the Lady Imps team, the women's team attached to Lincoln City. She became one of the youngest people to achieve the UEFA B coaching license in 2006. Other clubs include Navenby Archaeology Group, which aims to uncover the village's extensive historic past. There is also the Women's Institute, which has celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2007, and Artists of Navenby, a 40-strong group of artists. -LSB-edit-RSB- Middle Ages Navenby, originally an agricultural village, became a market town after receiving a charter from Edward the Confessor in the 11th century. -LSB-edit-RSB- Middle Ages Navenby, originally an agricultural village, became a market town after receiving a charter from Edward the Confessor in the 11th century.

Early members of the Church often encountered hostility, primarily due to their practice of withdrawing from secular society and gathering in locales to practice their distinct religious beliefs. Their neighbors felt threatened by the Church's rapid growth in numbers, by its tendency to vote as a bloc and acquire political power, by its claims of divine favor, and by the practice of polygamy. Violence directed against the Church and its members caused the body of the Church to move from Ohio to Missouri, then to Illinois. Despite the frequent moves, Church members were unable to escape opposition, which culminated in the extermination order against all Mormons living in the state by Missouri Governor Lilburn Boggs and the murder of its leader Joseph Smith in 1844. Brigham Young, Smith's successor as Church leader, said that he had received divine direction to organize the church members and head beyond the western frontier of the United States. -LSB-edit-RSB- Need for handcart companies Soon after the first Mormon pioneers reached Utah in 1847, the Church began encouraging its converts in the British Isles and elsewhere in Europe to emigrate to Utah. From 1849 to 1855, about 16,000 European Latter-day Saints traveled to Utah by ship, rail and then ox and wagon. Although most of these emigrants paid their own expenses, the Church established the Perpetual Emigration Fund to provide financial assistance for poor emigrants to trek west, which they would repay as they were able. Contributions to expand the fund were encouraged. When contributions and loan repayments dropped off in 1855 after a poor harvest in Utah, President Young decided to begin using handcarts because the Latter-day Saints who remained in Europe were mostly poor. Young also believed it would speed the journey. Young proposed the plan in a letter to Franklin D. Richards, President of the European Mission, in September 1855. His letter was published in the Millennial Star, the Church's England-based periodical, on December 22, 1855, along with an editorial by Richards endorsing the project. The cost of the migration was expected to be reduced by one-third. The response was overwhelming -- in 1856 the Perpetual Emigration Fund supported the travel of 2,012 European emigrants, compared with 1,161 the year before. -LSB-edit-RSB- Outfitting Emigrants departed from an English port -LRB-generally Liverpool-RRB- and travelled by ship to New York or Boston, then by railroad to Iowa City, Iowa, the western terminus of the rail line, where they would be outfitted with handcarts and other supplies. Built to Brigham Young's design, the handcarts resembled a large wheelbarrow, with two wheels five feet -LRB-1.5�m-RRB- in diameter and a single axle four and half feet -LRB-1.4�m-RRB- wide, and weighing 60 pounds -LRB-27�kg-RRB-. Running along each side of the bed were seven-foot -LRB-2.1 m-RRB- pull shafts ending with a three-foot -LRB-0.9�m-RRB- crossbar at the front. The crossbar allowed the carts to be pushed or pulled. Cargo was carried in a box about three feet by four feet -LRB-0.9�m by 1.2�m-RRB-, with 8 inch -LRB-0.2�m-RRB- walls. The handcarts generally carried up to 250 pounds -LRB-110�kg-RRB- of supplies and luggage, though they were capable of handling loads as heavy as 500 pounds -LRB-230�kg-RRB-. Carts used in the first year's migration were made entirely of wood -LRB-``Iowa hickory or oak''-RRB-; in later years a stronger design was substituted, which included metal elements. The handcart companies were organized using the handcarts and sleeping tents as the primary units. Five persons were assigned per handcart, with each individual limited to 17 pounds -LRB-7.7�kg-RRB- of clothing and bedding. Each round tent, supported by a center pole, housed 20 occupants and was supervised by a tent captain. Five tents were supervised by the captain of a hundred -LRB-or ``sub-captain''-RRB-. Provisions for each group of one hundred emigrants were carried in an ox wagon, and were distributed by the tent captains. -LSB-edit-RSB- 1856: First three companies The first two ships departed England in late March and mid-April and sailed to Boston. The emigrants spent several weeks in Iowa City, where they constructed their handcarts and were outfitted with supplies before beginning their trek of about 1,300 miles -LRB-2,093�km-RRB-. About 815 emigrants from the first two ships were organized into the first three handcart companies, headed by captains Edmund Ellsworth, Daniel D. McArthur, and Edward Bunker. The captains were missionaries returning to their homes in Utah and were familiar with the route. Most of the sub-captains were also returning missionaries. Across Iowa they followed an existing road about 275 miles -LRB-443�km-RRB- to Council Bluffs, following a route that is close to current U.S. Route 6. After crossing the Missouri River, they paused for a few days at a Mormon outpost in Florence, Nebraska -LRB-modern-day Omaha-RRB- for repairs, before beginning the remaining 1,030-mile -LRB-1,658�km-RRB- journey along the Mormon Trail to Salt Lake City. The companies made good time, and their trips were largely uneventful. The emigrant companies included many children and elderly individuals, and pushing and pulling handcarts was difficult work. Journals and recollections describe periods of illness and hunger. Like other companies traveling on the Emigrant Trail, deaths occurred along the way. Hafen and Hafen's Handcarts to Zion lists 13 deaths from the first company, seven from the second, and fewer than seven from the third. Journal entries reflect the optimism of the handcart pioneers, even amid their hardships:  The first two companies arrived in Salt Lake City on September 26 and the third followed less than a week later. The first three companies were regarded as having demonstrated the feasibility of emigrating using handcarts. -LSB-edit-RSB- 1856: Willie and Martin handcart companies The last two handcart companies of 1856 departed late from England. The ship Thornton, carrying the emigrants who became the Willie Company, did not leave England until May 4. The leader of the Latter-day Saints on the Thornton was James G. Willie. Another three weeks passed before the Horizon, carrying the emigrants who formed the Martin Company, departed. The late departures may have been the result of difficulties in procuring ships in response to the unexpected demand, but the results would be tragic. With slow communications in the era before the transatlantic telegraph, the Church agents in Iowa City were not expecting the additional emigrants and had to make frantic preparations for their arrival. Critical weeks were spent hastily assembling the carts and outfitting the companies. When the companies reached Florence, additional time was lost making repairs to the poorly built carts. Emigrant John Chislett describes the problems with the carts:  Prior to the Willie Company departing Florence, the company met to debate the wisdom of such a late departure. Because the emigrants were unfamiliar with the trail and the climate, they deferred to the returning missionaries and Church agents. One of the returning missionaries, Levi Savage, urged them to spend the winter in Nebraska. He argued that such a late departure with a company consisting of the elderly, women and young children would lead to suffering, sickness and even death. All of the other Church elders argued that the trip should go forward, expressing optimism that the company would be protected by divine intervention. Some members of the company, perhaps as many as 100, decided to spend the winter in Florence or in Iowa, but the majority, about 404 in number -LRB-including Savage-RRB- continued the journey west. The Willie Company left Florence on August 17 and the Martin Company on August 27. Two ox-wagon trains, led by captains W.B. Hodgett and John A. Hunt, followed the Martin Company. Near Wood River, Nebraska, a herd of bison caused the Willie Company's cattle to stampede, and nearly 30 cattle were lost. Left without enough cattle to pull all of the wagons, each handcart was required to take on an additional 100 pounds -LRB-45�kg-RRB- of flour. In early September, Franklin D. Richards, returning from Europe where he had served as the Church's mission president, passed the emigrant companies. Richards and the 12 returning missionaries who accompanied him, traveling in carriages and light wagons pulled by horses and mules, pressed on to Utah to obtain assistance for the emigrants. -LSB-edit-RSB- Disaster and rescue In early October the two companies reached Fort Laramie, Wyoming, where they expected to be restocked with provisions, but no provisions were there for them. The companies had to cut back food rations, hoping that their supplies would last until help could be sent from Utah. To lighten their loads, the Martin Company cut the luggage allowance to 10 pounds -LRB-4.5�kg-RRB- per person, discarding clothing and blankets that soon would be desperately needed. On October 4 the Richards party reached Salt Lake City and conferred with president Brigham Young and other Church leaders. The next morning the Church was meeting in a general conference, where Young and the other speakers called on the Church members to provide wagons, mules, supplies, and teamsters for a rescue mission. On the morning of October 7 the first rescue party left Salt Lake City with 16 wagonloads of food and supplies, pulled by four-mule teams with 27 young men serving as teamsters and rescuers. The party elected George D. Grant as their captain. Throughout October more wagon trains were assembled, and by the end of the month 250 relief wagons were on the road. Meanwhile, the Willie and Martin companies were running out of food and encountering bitterly cold temperatures. On October 19 a blizzard struck the region, halting the two companies and the relief party. The Willie Company was along the Sweetwater River approaching the Continental Divide. A scouting party sent ahead by the main rescue party found and greeted the emigrants, gave them a small amount of flour, encouraged them that rescue was near, and then rushed onward to try to locate the Martin Company. The members of the Willie Company had just reached the end of their flour supplies. They began slaughtering the handful of broken-down cattle that still remained while their death toll mounted. On October 20 Captain Willie and Joseph Elder went ahead by mule through the snow to locate the supply train and inform them of the company's desperate situation. They arrived at the rescue party's campsite near South Pass that evening, and by the next evening the rescue party reached the Willie Company and provided them with food and assistance. Half of the rescue party remained to assist the Willie Company while the other half pressed forward to assist the Martin Company. The difficulties of the Willie Company were not yet over. On October 23, the second day after the main rescue party had arrived, the Willie Company faced the most difficult section of the trail--the ascent up Rocky Ridge. The climb took place during a howling snowstorm through knee-deep snow. That night 13 emigrants died. On October 19, the Martin Company was about 110 miles -LRB-177�km-RRB- further east, making its last crossing of the North Platte River near present-day Casper, Wyoming. Shortly after completing the crossing, the blizzard struck. Many members of the company suffered from hypothermia or frostbite after wading through the frigid river. They set up camp at Red Bluffs, unable to continue forward through the snow. Meanwhile the original scouting party continued eastward until it reached a small vacant fort at Devil's Gate, where they had been instructed to wait for the rest of the rescue party if they had not found the Martin Company. When the main rescue party rejoined them, another scouting party consisting of Joseph Young, Abel Garr, and Daniel Webster Jones was sent forward. The Martin company remained in their camp at Red Bluffs for nine days until the three scouts finally arrived on October 28. By the time the scouts arrived, 56 members of the company had died. The scouts urged the emigrants to begin moving again. Three days later the main rescue party met the Martin Company and the Hodgett and Hunt wagon companies and helped them on to Devil's Gate. George D. Grant, who headed the rescue party, reported to President Young:  At Devil's Gate the rescue party unloaded the baggage carried in the wagons of the Hodgett and Hunt wagon companies that had been following the Martin Company so the wagons could be used to transport the weakest emigrants. A small group remained at Devil's Gate over the winter to protect the property. On November 4 the company had to cross the Sweetwater River, which was about 2 feet -LRB-0.6 m-RRB- deep and 90 to 120 feet -LRB-27 to 37 m-RRB- wide. The stream was clogged with floating ice. The young men of the rescue party -LRB-accounts mention George W. Grant, C. Allen Huntington, David P. Kimball, and Stephen W. Taylor-RRB- spent much of the day pulling the carts and carrying many of the emigrants across the river. Andrew Jensen later stated that some of the young rescuers died from the effects of the exposure. The severe weather forced the Martin Company to halt for another five days at Martin's Cove, a few miles west of Devil's Gate. The rescue parties escorted the emigrants from both companies to Utah through more snow and severe weather while their members continued to suffer death from disease and exposure. The Willie Company arrived in Salt Lake City on November 9; 68 members of the company had lost their lives. Meanwhile, a backup relief party of 77 teams and wagons was making its way east to provide additional assistance to the Martin Company. After passing Fort Bridger the leaders of the backup party concluded that the Martin Company must have wintered east of the Rockies, so they turned back. When word of the returning backup relief party was communicated to Young, he ordered the courier to return and tell them to turn back east and continue until they found the handcart company, but several days had been lost. On November 18 the backup party met the Martin Company with the greatly needed supplies. At last all the members of the handcart party were now able to ride in wagons. The 104 wagons carrying the Martin Company arrived in Salt Lake City on November 30; at least 145 members of the company had lost their lives. Many of the survivors had to have fingers, toes, or limbs amputated due to severe frostbite. After the companies arrived in Utah, the residents generously opened their homes to the arriving emigrants, feeding and caring for them over the winter. The emigrants would eventually go on to Latter-day Saint settlements throughout Utah and the West. -LSB-edit-RSB- Responsibility for the tragedy American West historian, Wallace Stegner, described the inadequate planning and improvident decisions leading to the tragedy when he wrote,  As early as November 2, 1856, while the Willie and Martin companies were still making their way to safety, Brigham Young responded to criticism of his own leadership by rebuking Franklin Richards and Daniel Spencer for allowing the companies to leave so late. However, many authors argued that Young, as author of the plan, was responsible. Ann Eliza Young, daughter of one of the men in charge of building the carts and a former plural wife of Brigham Young, described her ex-husband's plan as a ``cold-blooded, scheming, blasphemous policy.'' Stegner described Richards as a scapegoat for Young's fundamental errors in planning, though Howard Christy, professor emeritus at Brigham Young University, noted that Richards, as the highest ranking official in Florence, Nebraska area, was, in fact, the official who would have had the authority and capability to have averted the tragedy by halting their late departure. Many survivors of the tragedy refused to blame anyone. Survivor John Jacques wrote, ``I blame nobody. I am not anxious to blame anybody�... I have no doubt that those who had to do with its management meant well and tried to do the best they could under the circumstances.'' Another survivor, Francis Webster, was quoted as having said, ``Was I sorry that I chose to come by hand cart? Neither then nor any minute of my life since. The price we paid to become acquainted with God was a privilege to pay and I am thankful that I was privileged to come in the Martin Hand Cart Company.'' On the other hand, survivor John Chislett, who later left the Church, wrote bitterly of Richards promising them that ``we should get to Zion in safety.'' In May 2006, a panel of researchers at the annual conference of the Mormon History Association blamed the tragedy on a failure of leadership. Lyndia Carter, a trails historian, said Franklin D. Richards ``was responsible, in my mind, for the late departure'' because ``he started the snowball down the slope'' that eventually ``added up to disaster.'' Christy agreed that ``leadership from the top, from the outset, was seriously short of the mark.'' Robert Briggs, an attorney, said ``It's almost a foregone conclusion�... there is evidence of negligence. With leaders all the way up to Brigham Young, there was mismanagement.'' On the other hand, Rebecca Bartholomew and Leonard J. Arrington wrote, ``Memories of what was perhaps the worst disaster in the history of western migration have been palliated by what could also be regarded as the most heroic rescue of the Mormon frontier.'' -LSB-edit-RSB- 1857--60: Last five companies A number of lessons had been learned from the 1856 disaster that allowed the Church to continue the handcart system while avoiding another disaster. Never again would a handcart company depart Florence later than July 7. The construction of the handcarts was modified to strengthen them and reduce repairs. The handcarts would now be regularly greased. Arrangements were made to replenish supplies along the route. By 1857 the Perpetual Emigration Fund was exhausted; almost all of the handcart emigrants that year and in subsequent years had to pay their own way. With the increased cost, the number of handcart emigrants dropped from nearly 2,000 in 1856 to about 480 in 1857. Nevertheless, in 1857 two companies made the trek, both arriving in Salt Lake City by September 13. Perhaps the most notable incident was when a captain of the U.S. Army's Utah Expedition, on its way to Utah to confront Young and the Mormons, donated an ox to the hungry emigrants. With the uncertainty caused by the Utah War, the Church called off all European emigration for 1858. In 1859 one handcart company crossed the plains. The emigrants were now able to travel by rail to Saint Joseph, Missouri, after which they went by riverboat to Florence where they were outfitted with handcarts and supplies. When the 1859 company reached Fort Laramie, they discovered their food was running dangerously short, so they cut back on rations. When they reached Devil's Gate the last flour was distributed. Emigrant Ebeneezer B. Beesley recalled an incident in which a group of rough mountain men fed the hungry emigrants. One of the mountain men then asked a young woman from the company to stay with him, which the tired woman agreed to do. -LRB-William Atkin recalled another version of the story in which two young women married two mountain men.-RRB- The hunger worsened when expected supplies were not available when they reached the Green River. Three days later wagons from Utah carrying provisions finally rescued the famished emigrants. The last two handcart companies made the journey in 1860, again following the route through St. Joseph. Although the journey continued to be difficult for the emigrants, these companies had relatively uneventful trips and experienced little loss of life. After 1860 handcarts were no longer used. The Church implemented a new system of emigration, in which wagon trains travelled east from Salt Lake City in the spring and returned with emigrants in the summer. The transcontinental railroad was being constructed, and the railroad terminus gradually moved westward, shortening the trip. -LSB-edit-RSB- Legacy Handcart pioneers and the handcart movement are important parts of LDS culture, music and fiction. Arthur King Peters described the importance of this part of Mormon history in Seven Trails West:  Wallace Stegner praised the examples of those of the handcart companies, particularly in comparison to other pioneer parties:  -LSB-edit-RSB- Reenactments Reenactments, in which a group dressed in 19th century garb travels for one or more days pushing and pulling handcarts, have become a popular activity among LDS wards, youth groups, and families. The reenactments have been lauded by LDS leaders; for example, M. Russell Ballard of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles said, ``Through music, drama, and stirring reenactments, we will be reminded of incredible pioneer journeys, both temporal and spiritual.'' The reenactments have become so popular that the Bureau of Land Management is studying the impact on the trail and its environment, especially in the area around Rocky Ridge, Wyoming. According to the Casper Star-Tribune, the BLM has had to impose a fee to offset the costs of monitoring the impacts of reenactors and other campers on the trail. A re-creation of the 1856 handcart disaster was featured on the History Channel show, Wild West Tech. -LSB-edit-RSB- 150th anniversary A number of events were held during 2006 to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the 1856 handcart companies: Survivor John Jacques wrote, ``I blame nobody.

Its gameplay--a combination of the action-adventure, platform, and sometimes puzzle genres--shares elements with that of Lego Star Wars: The Video Game. While Lego Star Wars followed the events of The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith, Lego Star Wars II is based on A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. The game comically retells the trilogy's events using cut scenes without dialogue. The player assumes the roles of the films' characters, each of which possess specific weapons and abilities. At any time, a second player can join the game by activating a second controller. During game play, players can collect Lego studs--small, disk-shaped objects that serve as the game's currency. The player has a health meter, which is displayed on the game's heads-up display. The player's health is represented by four hearts; when these hearts are depleted the player dies and a small amount of their studs bounce away. However, they are instantly reincarnated and can often recollect the lost studs. The game's central location is the Mos Eisley Cantina, a spaceport bar on the planet Tatooine. At the counter, the player may use their Lego studs to purchase characters, vehicles, gameplay hints and extras, or activate cheat codes. In a small area outside the cantina, players may view collected vehicles. The game is broken into levels, which are accessed from the cantina; each film is represented by six levels, representing key locations and scenes in that film. The locations include Hoth, Bespin, Dagobah, Tatooine, the Death Star, and Endor. The game also features bonus levels. During levels, the player defeats enemies, builds objects out of Lego bricks and drives vehicles, Certain levels are played entirely while piloting vehicles, including a TIE fighter, a Snowspeeder, and the Millennium Falcon. Levels must first be played in story mode. This unlocks the next level as well as a ``free play'' mode for the recently completed level. Gameplay is identical in the two modes. However, story mode restricts playable characters to those followed in the film scenes the levels are based on, while free play offers all those unlocked. Levels can be replayed in either mode to collect studs and secret items. Three types of secret items are available: gold bricks, minikits and power bricks. Within each level is hidden one power brick. When a power brick is collected, its corresponding extra, such as invincibility or stud multipliers, becomes available for purchase. Each level also contains ten hidden minikits, that is, ten pieces of a Star Wars vehicle. When all ten have been collected, the player is awarded a gold brick. Collecting a certain number of gold bricks unlocks free rewards, such as a spigot that spews out studs. Gold bricks are also awarded when levels are completed and when a predefined number of studs is accumulated in a level; ninety-nine gold bricks are available. The vehicles represented by the minikits are displayed outside the cantina. As each vehicle is completed -LRB-all ten minikits collected-RRB-, it becomes available for play in a bonus level. -LSB-edit-RSB- Playable characters Over 50 characters from the films are playable over the course of the game, including Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, R2-D2, C-3PO, Darth Vader, an Ewok, and Boba Fett. Character abilities have a greater role in Lego Star Wars II than in Lego Star Wars. Certain characters armed with guns can use a grappling hook in predesignated areas. Characters wielding lightsabers can deflect projectiles, double jump and use the Force. R2-D2, C-3PO, and other droid characters are needed to open certain doors. Small characters like the Ewok can crawl through hatches to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. Bounty hunters, such as Boba Fett, may use thermal detonators to destroy otherwise indestructible objects. Sith, like Darth Vader, can use the Force to manipulate black Lego objects. Some characters have unique abilities; for example, Chewbacca can rip enemies' arms from their sockets, Darth Vader can choke enemies with the Force, Princess Leia possesses a slap attack, and Lando Calrissian can use a kung-fu-like attack. Special abilities are often necessary to unlock secrets, and story mode does not always provide characters with needed abilities. This means that some secrets can only be found in free play mode. The player can unlock the ``Use Old Save'' extra, which imports all unlocked characters from Lego Star Wars for use in free play; however, a Lego Star Wars saved game must be present on the same memory card that contains Lego Star Wars II's save data. Players can create two customized characters in the Mos Eisley Cantina. These characters can be built using both miscellaneous parts and those of unlocked characters; millions of combinations are possible. Entering two cheat codes, publicized by IGN, makes pieces for a Santa Claus character available. The game generates names for the characters based on the pieces used -LRB-for example, a character made from pieces of Darth Vader and C-3PO might have the name ``Darth-3PO''-RRB-; alternately, the player may create a name. -LSB-edit-RSB- Development Lego Star Wars II was created by the Cheshire, England, game developer Traveller's Tales. LucasArts--busy with other projects--had deferred publishing of Lego Star Wars to Eidos Interactive, but regained the ``necessary resources'' to publish its sequel alongside TT Games. Lego Star Wars II was created for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Xbox, GameCube, PlayStation 2, Game Boy Advance -LRB-GBA-RRB-, Nintendo DS, PlayStation Portable -LRB-PSP-RRB-, and Xbox 360. Differences exist between platforms: the DS and GBA versions have some different playable characters than the other versions, and the DS and PSP versions support a ``Wireless Lobby'' for multiplayer gameplay. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 2 versions of the game feature higher-definition graphics. Lego Star Wars II uses a modified Lego Star Wars engine. However, many gameplay improvements were made over its predecessor, most notably camera angles and movement. Camera movement in co-op was a specific point of concern, as LucasArts received critical feedback from fans over this issue. TT Games looked to expand upon the concept of levels completed entirely in vehicles. These ``vehicle levels'' were explored more thoroughly in Lego Star Wars II than in its predecessor. In response to complaints from fans, LucasArts and Traveller's Tales granted the ability to build bricks to all non-droid characters. Character customization, an entirely new concept, was considered a significant improvement over the original game, and is one of three features highlighted on the game's final back cover. Tom Stone, director at TT Games, stated of the various improvements made over the original game: The designers attempted to recreate the films' characters and events in a ``cute'' way. Assistant producer Jeff Gullet said that, in the game's recreation of a Return of the Jedi scene where Luke Skywalker ``jumps off the plank ... and somersaults onto the skiff'', Skywalker ``performs an all-out acrobatic routine with all sorts of jumps from the plank. LucasArts producer David Perkinson said, ''-LSB-u-RSB-nless you've got the heart of the Emperor, you are going to chuckle at many of -LSB-the characters-RSB- the first time you see them -- you just have to. -LSB-edit-RSB- Marketing and release history On February 2, 2006, images of the game were leaked to the Internet. However, they were quickly removed, and LucasArts, if telephoned, did not confirm or deny the game's development. The game was formally announced on February 10 at American International Toy Fair 2006. A preview was later hosted at Electronic Entertainment Expo -LRB-E3-RRB- 2006. Because the original Lego Star Wars had been well received commercially and critically, selling 3.3 million copies by March 2006 and winning several awards, its sequel was highly anticipated by both fans of the original game and video game publications such as IGN and GameSpot. Shortly before the game's release, promotions were set up at chain stores across the United States, including Toys ``R'' Us, Wal-Mart, Target, Best Buy, GameStop, and Circuit City. In Europe, Lego Star Wars II was released on September 11, 2006 for PC, Xbox, GameCube, GBA, DS, and Xbox 360; on September 15 for PlayStation 2; and on November 10 for PSP. The game's North American release fell on September 12 for all platforms, coinciding with the release of the individual two-disc DVD releases of the films on which it was based. The game's Australian release fell on September 15 for all platforms, but the Xbox 360 version was not released in this region. The Mac OS X version of the game was released in 2007. The game received a rating of E10+ from the Entertainment Software Rating Board -LRB-for ``cartoon violence'' and ``crude humor''-RRB- and 3+ from PEGI. -LSB-edit-RSB- Mobile phone adaptation A mobile phone adaptation of the game was developed by Universomo and published by THQ. It was released on December 19, 2006. Several gameplay features--such as two-dimensional graphics, limited character selection, and coverage only of the film A New Hope--distinguish this version of the game from the versions for other platforms. -LSB-edit-RSB- Compilation Lego Star Wars and Lego Star Wars II were compiled in Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga, developed by Traveller's Tales and published by LucasArts. The Complete Saga incorporated improvements from the sequel into the original game, and expanded the Mos Eisley Cantina to allow access to both games' levels. It was created for Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS. It was released on November 6, 2007. -LSB-edit-RSB- Reception -LSB-edit-RSB- Critical response Upon release, Lego Star Wars II was generally well-received by critics, who praised its portrayal of the films' characters and events. Nintendo Power staff writer Chris Shepperd claimed that ''-LSB-t-RSB-he adorable LEGO adaptations also led to some hilarious story moments--the `I am your father' scene from Empire is priceless''. Reviewers from GameSpy, 1UP.com, GameSpot, IGN, and PlayStation: The Official Magazine offered similar opinions. Shepperd and Variety's Ben Fritz called the game ``adorable''. In reviews of the Xbox 360 version, Official Xbox Magazine praised the game's ``off-kilter humor'', and Electronic Gaming Monthly stated that ''-LSB-y-RSB-ou have to give credit to the brilliant blockhead who forced this awesome yet fundamentally bizarro idea on LucasArts.'' The game was praised as a result of reviewers' preference of the original trilogy over the prequel trilogy. Anthony Reiner of Game Informer said that ``comparing -LSB-the prequel trilogy-RSB- to the films in the original trilogy is similar to comparing Jar Jar Binks to Han Solo''. Shepperd praised the level design of Lego Star Wars II, and called its predecessor's environments ``sterile''. These views were echoed by reviewers from 1UP.com, Variety, GameSpot, GameSpy, Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine -LRB-for the PlayStation 2-RRB-, and BusinessWeek. Critics were divided on the game's level of difficulty. Fritz claimed that, though Lego Star Wars II provided only a ``short journey'', it was ``loads of fun''. GameSpot's Ryan Davis estimated that it could be completed in six hours, but praised its bonus content. GameSpy and 1UP.com's reviewers thought similarly. A review by USA Today's Brett Molina claimed that ''-LSB-t-RSB-he game's difficulty is balanced well enough so kids won't feel too frustrated while older gamers will still find a solid challenge'' and gave the game an overall score of 8 out of 10. Official Xbox Magazine's review praised its ``weird puzzles''. IGN's Jeremy Dunham and Reiner were more critical of the perceived low difficulty. Critics disliked the game's Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS versions. Davis believed that the Game Boy Advance version could be completed in two hours. GameSpy staff writer Phil Theobald bemoaned this version's poor controls, easy levels and vehicle-piloting sections. He concluded that ``for goodness sake, -LSB-one should-RSB- buy one of the -LSB-home-RSB- console versions''. Theobald, Davis, and IGN's Craig Harris criticized the high number of glitches in the DS version. -LSB-edit-RSB- Awards and accolades Lego Star Wars II won and was nominated for numerous awards, and ranked on several video game lists. The official Star Wars website declared Lego Star Wars II to be the best Star Wars-related product of 2006. The game won iParenting Media Awards' ``2006 Greatest Products Call'', and was placed on Reader's Digest's September 2006 ``5 Things We Don't Want You to Miss'' list, Time magazine's list of the top ten video games of 2006, and GameSpy's PC ``Game of the Year'' list. It received the 2006 Game of the Year award from Nick Jr. and from IGN -LRB-for PC games only-RRB-. It won Spike TV Video Game Awards 2006's ``Best Game Based on a Movie or TV Show'', and ``Best Gameplay'' from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts's 3rd British Academy Video Games Awards. It received BAFTA nominations in three other categories, including ``Best Game''. In contrast, the previously poorly received DS version was listed as one of the ``tears'' on IGN's September 2009 ``Cheers & Tears'' list of action games for the DS. -LSB-edit-RSB- Sales Lego Star Wars II sold over 1.1�million copies worldwide in its opening week. The PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox 360, and Xbox versions were the third, fifth, eighth, and ninth-best selling games of September 2006, respectively. The GameCube, Xbox, and PlayStation 2 versions were the third, eighth, and ninth-best selling games of 2006, respectively. All platforms except PC combined, the game was the third-highest selling of 2006 in the United States, behind Madden NFL 07 and Cars. All platforms combined, the game was the fifth-highest selling of 2006 in the United Kingdom. The GameCube, GBA, and DS versions were the first, second, and fifth best-selling of January 2007 for their respective platforms. By May 2, 2009, the game's worldwide sales had surpassed 8.2 million. It has been certified as part of the budget lines Platinum Hits for the Xbox 360, Greatest Hits for the PlayStation 2 -LRB-each represents a worldwide sales total of at least 400,000 on its respective platform-RRB-, and Player's Choice for the GameCube -LRB-250,000-RRB-. -LSB-edit-RSB- Legacy Jeff Bell, corporate vice president of global marketing for Microsoft, commended Lego Star Wars II for expanding the range of consumers for the Xbox 360, noting its family-friendly appeal. Character customization--a new feature in Lego Star Wars II--reappeared in subsequent Lego video games such as Lego Batman: The Videogame. These ``vehicle levels'' were explored more thoroughly in Lego Star Wars II than in its predecessor.

During the 1980s, astronomers saw that the nascent technologies which formed the basis of the Internet could eventually be used to build an electronic indexing system of astronomical research papers which would allow astronomers to keep abreast of a much greater range of research. The first suggestion of a database of journal paper abstracts was made at a conference on Astronomy from Large Data-bases held in Garching bei München in 1987. Initial development of an electronic system for accessing astrophysical abstracts took place during the following two years; in 1991 discussions took place on how to integrate ADS with the SIMBAD database, containing all available catalog designations for objects outside the solar system, to create a system where astronomers could search for all the papers written about a given object. An initial version of ADS, with a database consisting of 40 papers, was created as a proof of concept in 1988, and the ADS database was successfully connected with the SIMBAD database in the summer of 1993. The creators believed this was the first use of the Internet to allow simultaneous querying of transatlantic scientific databases. Until 1994, the service was available via proprietary network software, but it was transferred to the nascent World Wide Web early that year. The number of users of the service quadrupled in the five weeks following the introduction of the ADS web-based service. At first, the journal articles available via ADS were scanned bitmaps created from the paper journals, but from 1995 onwards, the Astrophysical Journal began to publish an on-line edition, soon followed by the other main journals such as Astronomy and Astrophysics and the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. ADS provided links to these electronic editions from their first appearance. Since about 1995, the number of ADS users has doubled roughly every two years. ADS now has agreements with almost all astronomical journals, who supply abstracts. Scanned articles from as far back as the early 19th century are available via the service, which now contains over eight million documents. The service is distributed worldwide, with twelve mirror sites in twelve countries on five continents, with the database synchronized by means of weekly updates using rsync, a mirroring utility which allows updates to only the portions of the database which have changed. All updates are triggered centrally, but they initiate scripts at the mirror sites which ``pull'' updated data from the main ADS servers. -LSB-edit-RSB- Data in the system Papers are indexed within the database by their bibliographic record, containing the details of the journal they were published in and various associated metadata, such as author lists, references and citations. Originally this data was stored in ASCII format, but eventually the limitations of this encouraged the database maintainers to migrate all records to an XML -LRB-Extensible Markup Language-RRB- format in 2000. Bibliographic records are now stored as an XML element, with sub-elements for the various metadata. Since the advent of online editions of journals, abstracts are loaded into the ADS on or before the publication date of articles, with the full journal text available to subscribers. Older articles have been scanned, and an abstract is created using optical character recognition software. Scanned articles from before about 1995 are usually available free, by agreement with the journal publishers. Scanned articles are stored in TIFF format, at both medium and high resolution. The TIFF files are converted on demand into GIF files for on-screen viewing, and PDF or PostScript files for printing. The generated files are then cached to eliminate needlessly frequent regenerations for popular articles. As of 2000, ADS contained 250 GB of scans, which consisted of 1,128,955 article pages comprising 138,789 articles. By 2005 this had grown to 650 GB, and is expected to grow further, to about 900 GB by 2007. No further information has been published. The database initially contained only astronomical references, but has now grown to incorporate three databases, covering astronomy -LRB-including planetary sciences and solar physics-RRB- references, physics -LRB-including instrumentation and geosciences-RRB- references, as well as preprints of scientific papers from arXiv. The astronomy database is by far the most advanced and its use accounts for about 85% of the total ADS usage. Articles are assigned to the different databases according to the subject rather than the journal they are published in, so that articles from any one journal might appear in all three subject databases. The separation of the databases allows searching in each discipline to be tailored, so that words can automatically be given different weight functions in different database searches, depending on how common they are in the relevant field. Data in the preprint archive is updated daily from the arXiv, the main repository of physics and astronomy preprints. The advent of preprint servers has, like ADS, had a significant impact on the rate of astronomical research, as papers are often made available from preprint servers weeks or months before they are published in the journals. The incorporation of preprints from the arXiv into ADS means that the search engine can return the most current research available, with the caveat that preprints may not have been peer reviewed or proofread to the required standard for publication in the main journals. ADS's database links preprints with subsequently published articles wherever possible, so that citation and reference searches will return links to the journal article where the preprint was cited. -LSB-edit-RSB- Software and hardware The software runs on a system that was written specifically for it, allowing for extensive customization for astronomical needs that would not have been possible with general purpose database software. The scripts are designed to be as platform independent as possible, given the need to facilitate mirroring on different systems around the world, although the growing use of Linux as the operating system of choice within astronomy has led to increasing optimization of the scripts for installation on that platform. The main ADS server is located at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and is a dual 64-bit X86 Intel server with two quad-core 3.0 GHz CPUs and 32 GB of RAM, running the CentOS 5.4 Linux distribution. Mirrors are located in Brazil, China, Chile, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, South Korea, United Kingdom, and the Ukraine. -LSB-edit-RSB- Indexing ADS currently receives abstracts or tables of contents from almost two hundred journal sources. The service may receive data referring to the same article from multiple sources, and creates one bibliographic reference based on the most accurate data from each source. The common use of TeX and LaTeX by almost all scientific journals greatly facilitates the incorporation of bibliographic data into the system in a standardized format, and importing HTML-coded web-based articles is also simple. ADS utilizes Perl scripts for importing, processing and standardizing bibliographic data. The apparently mundane task of converting author names into a standard Surname, Initial format is actually one of the more difficult to automate, due to the wide variety of naming conventions around the world and the possibility that a given name such as Davis could be a first name, middle name or surname. The accurate conversion of names requires a detailed knowledge of the names of authors active in astronomy, and ADS maintains an extensive database of author names, which is also used in searching the database -LRB-see below-RRB-. For electronic articles, a list of the references given at the end of the article is easily extracted. For scanned articles, reference extraction relies on OCR. The reference database can then be ``inverted'' to list the citations for each paper in the database. Citation lists have been used in the past to identify popular articles missing from the database; mostly these were from before 1975 and have now been added to the system. -LSB-edit-RSB- Coverage The database now contains over eight million articles. In the cases of the major journals of astronomy -LRB-Astrophysical Journal, Astronomical Journal, Astronomy and Astrophysics, Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific and the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society-RRB-, coverage is complete, with all issues indexed from number 1 to the present. These journals account for about two-thirds of the papers in the database, with the rest consisting of papers published in over 100 other journals from around the world. While the database contains the complete contents of all the major journals and many minor ones as well, its coverage of references and citations is much less complete. References in and citations of articles in the major journals are fairly complete, but references such as ``private communication'', ``in press'' or ``in preparation'' cannot be matched, and author errors in reference listings also introduce potential errors. Astronomical papers may cite and be cited by articles in journals which fall outside the scope of ADS, such as chemistry, mathematics or biology journals. -LSB-edit-RSB- Search engine Since its inception, the ADS has developed a highly complex search engine to query the abstract and object databases. The search engine is tailor-made for searching astronomical abstracts, and the engine and its user interface assume that the user is well-versed in astronomy and able to interpret search results which are designed to return more than just the most relevant papers. The database can be queried for author names, astronomical object names, title words, and words in the abstract text, and results can be filtered according to a number of criteria. It works by first gathering synonyms and simplifying search terms as described above, and then generating an ``inverted file'', which is a list of all the documents matching each search term. The user-selected logic and filters are then applied to this inverted list to generate the final search results. -LSB-edit-RSB- Author name queries The system indexes author names by surname and initials, and accounts for the possible variations in spelling of names using a list of variations. This is common in the case of names including accents such as umlauts and transliterations from Arabic or Cyrillic script. An example of an entry in the author synonym list is: -LSB-edit-RSB- Object name searches The capability to search for papers on specific astronomical objects is one of ADS's most powerful tools. The system uses data from the SIMBAD, the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database, the International Astronomical Union Circulars and the Lunar and Planetary Institute to identify papers referring to a given object, and can also search by object position, listing papers which concern objects within a 10�arcminute radius of a given Right Ascension and Declination. These databases combine the many catalogue designations an object might have, so that a search for the Pleiades will also find papers which list the famous open cluster in Taurus under any of its other catalog designations or popular names, such as M45, the Seven Sisters or Melotte 22. -LSB-edit-RSB- Title and abstract searches The search engine first filters search terms in several ways. An M followed by a space or hyphen has the space or hyphen removed, so that searching for Messier catalogue objects is simplified and a user input of M45, M 45 or M-45 all result in the same query being executed; similarly, NGC designations and common search terms such as Shoemaker Levy and T Tauri are stripped of spaces. Unimportant words such as AT, OR and TO are stripped out, although in some cases case sensitivity is maintained, so that while and is ignored, And is converted to ``Andromedae'', and Her is converted to ``Herculis'', but her is ignored. -LSB-edit-RSB- Synonym replacement Once search terms have been pre-processed, the database is queried with the revised search term, as well as synonyms for it. As well as simple synonym replacement such as searching for both plural and singular forms, ADS also searches for a large number of specifically astronomical synonyms. For example, spectrograph and spectroscope have basically the same meaning, and in an astronomical context metallicity and abundance are also synonymous. ADS's synonym list was created manually, by grouping the list of words in the database according to similar meanings. As well as English language synonyms, ADS also searches for English translations of foreign search terms and vice versa, so that a search for the French word soleil retrieves references to Sun, and papers in languages other than English can be returned by English search terms. Synonym replacement can be disabled if required, so that a rare term which is a synonym of a much more common term -LRB-such as `dateline' rather than `date'-RRB- can be searched for specifically. -LSB-edit-RSB- Selection logic The search engine allows selection logic both within fields and between fields. Search terms in each field can be combined with OR, AND, simple logic or Boolean logic, and the user can specify which fields must be matched in the search results. This allows complex searches to be built; for example, the user could search for papers concerning NGC 6543 OR NGC 7009, with the paper titles containing -LRB-radius OR velocity-RRB- AND NOT -LRB-abundance OR temperature-RRB-. -LSB-edit-RSB- Result filtering Search results can be filtered according to a number of criteria, including specifying a range of years such as '1945 to 1975', '2000 to the present day' or `before 1900', and what type of journal the article appears in -- non-peer reviewed articles such as conference proceedings can be excluded or specifically searched for, or specific journals can be included in or excluded from the search. -LSB-edit-RSB- Search results Although it was conceived as a means of accessing abstracts and papers, ADS provides a substantial amount of ancillary information along with search results. For each abstract returned, links are provided to other papers in the database which are referenced, and which cite the paper, and a link is provided to a preprint, where one exists. The system also generates a link to `also-read' articles -- that is, those which have been most commonly accessed by those reading the article. In this way, an ADS user can determine which papers are of most interest to astronomers who are interested in the subject of a given paper. Also returned are links to the SIMBAD and/or NASA Extragalactic Database object name databases, via which a user can quickly find out basic observational data about the objects analyzed in a paper, and find further papers on those objects. -LSB-edit-RSB- Impact on astronomy ADS is almost universally used as a research tool among astronomers, and there are several studies that have estimated quantitatively how much more efficient ADS has made astronomy; one estimated that ADS increased the efficiency of astronomical research by 333�full-time equivalent research years per year, and another found that in 2002 its effect was equivalent to 736�full-time researchers, or all the astronomical research done in France. ADS has allowed literature searches that would previously have taken days or weeks to carry out to be completed in seconds, and it is estimated that ADS has increased the readership and use of the astronomical literature by a factor of about three since its inception. In monetary terms, this increase in efficiency represents a considerable amount. There are about 12,000�active astronomical researchers worldwide, so ADS is the equivalent of about 5% of the working population of astronomers. The global astronomical research budget is estimated at between 4,000 and 5,000�million USD, so the value of ADS to astronomy would be about 200--250�million USD annually. Its operating budget is a small fraction of this amount. The great importance of ADS to astronomers has been recognized by the United Nations, the General Assembly of which has commended ADS on its work and success, particularly noting its importance to astronomers in the developing world, in reports of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. A 2002 report by a visiting committee to the Center for Astrophysics, meanwhile, said that the service had ``revolutionized the use of the astronomical literature'', and was ``probably the most valuable single contribution to astronomy research that the CfA has made in its lifetime''. -LSB-edit-RSB- Sociological studies using ADS Because it is used almost universally by astronomers, ADS can reveal much about how astronomical research is distributed around the world. Most users access the system from institutes of higher education, whose IP address can easily be used to determine the user's geographical location. Studies reveal that the highest per-capita users of ADS are France and Netherlands-based astronomers, and while more developed countries -LRB-measured by GDP per capita-RRB- use the system more than less developed countries; the relationship between GDP per capita and ADS use is not linear. The range of ADS usage per capita far exceeds the range of GDPs per capita, and basic research carried out in a country, as measured by ADS usage, has been found to be proportional to the square of the country's GDP divided by its population. ADS usage statistics also suggest that astronomers in more developed countries tend to be more productive than those in less developed countries. The amount of basic research carried out is proportional to the number of astronomers in a country multiplied by the GDP per capita. Statistics also imply that astronomers in European cultures carry out about three times as much research as those in Asian cultures, perhaps suggesting cultural differences in the importance attached to astronomical research. ADS has also been used to show that the fraction of single-author astronomy papers has decreased substantially since 1975 and that astronomical papers with more than 50 authors have become more common since 1990. -LSB-edit-RSB- Comparision to what the National Library of Medicine has done The National Library of Medicine also has a free to users, supported by tax dollars, online database of scientific publications, PubMed. -LSB-edit-RSB- Impact on astronomy ADS is almost universally used as a research tool among astronomers, and there are several studies that have estimated quantitatively how much more efficient ADS has made astronomy; one estimated that ADS increased the efficiency of astronomical research by 333�full-time equivalent research years per year, and another found that in 2002 its effect was equivalent to 736�full-time researchers, or all the astronomical research done in France. -LSB-edit-RSB- Impact on astronomy ADS is almost universally used as a research tool among astronomers, and there are several studies that have estimated quantitatively how much more efficient ADS has made astronomy; one estimated that ADS increased the efficiency of astronomical research by 333�full-time equivalent research years per year, and another found that in 2002 its effect was equivalent to 736�full-time researchers, or all the astronomical research done in France. -LSB-edit-RSB- Impact on astronomy ADS is almost universally used as a research tool among astronomers, and there are several studies that have estimated quantitatively how much more efficient ADS has made astronomy; one estimated that ADS increased the efficiency of astronomical research by 333�full-time equivalent research years per year, and another found that in 2002 its effect was equivalent to 736�full-time researchers, or all the astronomical research done in France.

It is a centre-left social democratic party which is formally linked to the trade union labour movement. On a state level, Labor has been in government since 2002, after having been in opposition from 1993 to 2002. Since the 1970 election ending decades of electoral malapportionment of the Playmander, nine of 12 elections have been won by Labor. Labor's premiers in South Australia include Thomas Price in the 1900s, to the reformist Don Dunstan in the 1970s to the factionally nonaligned and pragmatic current premier, Mike Rann. The party's deputy leader, and therefore the Deputy Premier, is Kevin Foley. -LSB-edit-RSB- Liberal Party of Australia The Liberal Party of Australia is a centre-right conservative liberal party -LRB-see Liberalism in Australia-RRB-, with close links to business and advocating free markets. Whilst primarily a social conservative party, there exists a more social liberal wing, colloquially known as `wet', `moderate' or small-l liberals, highlighted by the short-lived Liberal Movement who first contested the 1975 election as a separate party led by Steele Hall. At state level, the Liberal Party of Australia in 1973 descended from the Liberal and Country League -LRB-LCL-RRB-, which resulted from a merger between the Liberal Federation and the then-Country Party in 1932. The state opposition leader at the 2006 election, Rob Kerin, was factionally nonaligned. -LSB-edit-RSB- Nationals SA The Nationals SA are a sub-division of the conservative National Party of Australia -LRB-formerly the Country Party-RRB-. First contesting the 1965 election, they have only held two seats at alternating periods; Flinders -LRB-1973--1993-RRB- and Chaffey -LRB-1997--current-RRB-. Their sole member and leader, Karlene Maywald, representing the Riverland district of Chaffey, accepted a cabinet position in the Rann Labor government, as Minister for the River Murray, Minister for Regional Development, Minister for Small Business, and later Minister for Water Security. This informal ALP-NAT coalition -LRB-the first since 1935-RRB- caused uproar, with Christopher Pyne calling for Maywald's expulsion from the Nationals and Patrick Secker calling for a corruption enquiry in to the appointment -- neither eventuated. As the Liberal Party in South Australia is descended from a historical merger from an earlier Country Party, the SA Nationals are not as dominant in rural areas as their eastern state counterparts. -LSB-edit-RSB- SA Greens The SA Greens, founded in 1995 are a sub-division of the left-wing Australian Greens. They are based on green politics and consider themselves a new politics party with strong beliefs in ecology, democracy and social justice amongst other issues. Federally and locally they have seen a continued rise in primary votes, in part due to the demise of the Australian Democrats. The 2007 federal election saw 77.28% of preferences flow to Labor over the Liberal Party in SA. The party's leader is Mark Parnell. -LSB-edit-RSB- Family First Party The Family First Party, founded immediately before the 2002 state election, has a political ideology based on Christian-influenced conservatism. Although officially a secular party, it has close links to the Pentecostal movement, and in particular the Assemblies of God denomination, and its social policies generally mirror conservative Christian values -LRB-but not necessarily politically conservative values-RRB-. The 2007 federal election saw 57.10% of preferences flow to the Liberals over the Labor Party in SA. The party's leader at the time of the election was Andrew Evans. -LSB-edit-RSB- Australian Democrats The Australian Democrats were originally a centrist party, with most current policies based on social liberalism. Federally, the party was founded in 1977 from three different groups, all of which had split from the Liberal Party at different times: the Liberal Movement, which had split from its parent over electoral reform; the Australia Party, which had rebelled against Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War, and initial leader Don Chipp, who left the Liberal Party of Australia, dissatisfied with the increasing underrepresentation of small-l liberals. At the state level it is descended from the New Liberal Movement -LRB-New LM-RRB- of Robin Millhouse, who held the Democrats' only lower house seats, Mitcham and its successor seat Waite. The Democrats have suffered internal problems and leadership scuffles since 1997. The 2007 federal election saw 65.79% of preferences flow to Labor over the Liberal Party in SA. The party's leader is Sandra Kanck. -LSB-edit-RSB- Electoral system South Australia is governed according to the principles of the Westminster system, a form of parliamentary government based on the model of the United Kingdom. Legislative power rests with the Parliament of South Australia, which consists of The Sovereign -LRB-represented by the Governor of South Australia-RRB-, the House of Assembly -LRB-lower house-RRB- which forms government, and the Legislative Council -LRB-upper house-RRB- as a house of review. Forty-seven members of the lower house represent single-member electorates and are elected under the preferential Instant-runoff voting -LRB-IRV-RRB- system for fixed four-year terms. The independent State Electoral Office, which conducts elections, is responsible for a mandatory redistricting of boundaries before each election to ensure one vote one value. At each election, voters choose half of the 22 upper house members, each of whom serve eight-year terms in a single statewide electorate. The Legislative Council is elected under the preferential Single Transferable Vote -LRB-STV-RRB- system through a means of Group voting tickets. Voters can choose to vote for a ticket by placing the number '1' in one of the ticket boxes ``above the line'' or can vote for individual candidates by numbering all the boxes ``below the line'' -LRB-54 in the 2006 election-RRB-. In above the line voting, ticket votes are distributed according to the party or group voting ticket registered before the election with the election management body. As most ballot papers are above the line, this form of voting often leads to pre-election trading between parties on how each party will allocate later preferences to other parties and candidates. Voting is compulsory once enrolled in South Australian elections, which results in turnout rates above 90 percent. Informal voting, which occurs when a voting slip is not valid, is at a rate of under five percent. Voting slips are informal when they are not filled out correctly, such examples are not numbering subsequent numbers, not filling out all the candidate boxes with numbers -LRB-except the last candidate-RRB-, or in some other way that is verified by the State Electoral Office as illegible. South Australian elections have some features that are unique to the rest of Australia. As elections have fixed four-year terms, the election date of 18 March 2006 was known well ahead of time. The Electoral Act stipulates that the election is to be held on the third Saturday in March every four years. The election campaign must run for a minimum of 25 days or a maximum of 55 days, therefore the Governor would have needed to issue writs for the election by 21 February 2006 at the latest. On 20 February, Premier Mike Rann invited Governor Marjorie Jackson-Nelson to issue writs for the election. In accordance with electoral regulations, the Electoral Commissioner then advertised key dates for the election of the House of Assembly and half of the Legislative Council -- close of rolls on 27 February 2006 at noon, nominations to be received by 2 March 2006 at noon, polling day on 18 March 2006, and the return of writs on or before 28 April 2006. -LSB-edit-RSB- Election background In the 2002 election, Labor won 23 seats, the Liberals 20, Nationals 1, and conservative Independents won three. As 24 seats are required to govern, the Liberal Party was expected to retain government with the support of all four independents. However, in a surprise decision, one of the conservative independents, Peter Lewis, decided to support Labor in exchange for holding a constitutional convention, making him speaker of the House of Assembly, and concessions for his electorate including the phasing out of commercial fishing in the River Murray, prioritising the eradication of the branched broomrape weed, changing water rates for irrigation, fast-tracking a feasibility study for a weir and lock at Wellington, and improving rural roads. Lewis resigned as speaker in April 2005 after controversy over allegations of paedophilia he had made about a serving MP. However, by this time, Labor had already gained the support of independents Bob Such and Rory McEwen in 2002, as well as Nationals SA member Karlene Maywald in 2004. Such was given the position of speaker for the remainder of the government's term. -LSB-edit-RSB- Campaign The Labor campaign was heavily based around Premier Mike Rann with Labor's advertising swapping between the mottos ``Building South Australia'' and, to a greater extent, ``RANN Gets Results''. Commentators also argued that the ``presidential'' style of campaign could be seen in Labor's formal campaign launch at the Norwood Town Hall the Sunday before the election, which had some similarities to the nomination conventions that the major parties hold in the United States. Another facet of the Labor campaign was extensive negative campaigning against Liberal leader Rob Kerin, including an advertisement featuring an excerpt of an interview that Kerin had with FIVEaa presenter Keith Conlon where Conlon asked Kerin why he wanted to be leader of the Liberal Party. Kerin stammered for a few seconds and gave the impression that he was uncertain. The advertisement concluded with the question, ``Does Rob Want The Job?'' Conlon complained that the advertisement gave the false impression that he was endorsing Labor, but Labor campaign director David Feeney dismissed his concerns. Other negative advertisements run by Labor revolved around the actions of the previous Liberal government -- one advertisement and leaflet reminded voters that while in power, the previous Liberal government closed 65 schools, closed hospital wards, and privatised the Electricity Trust of South Australia. Considered ``strapped for cash'', the Liberal Party ran a very limited television and radio campaign. Businessman Robert Gerard was forced to resign from his Federal Liberal Party-appointed position on the board of the Reserve Bank of Australia due to the party appointing him to the position despite the known fact that he had outstanding tax avoidance issues being dealt with by the Australian Taxation Office, and had thus subsequently pulled out of his traditional role of bankrolling the state division of the party, leaving the party with ``only enough funds for the most basic campaign''. Kerin indicated people would have to ``wait and see'' if there would be any campaign, even asking trade unions for donations, no matter how small. The advertisements that did run argued that Labor was wasting record tax receipts from the GST. A number of embarrassments for the Liberal Party surrounded their television advertisement -- in an early version released to journalists, Labor was spelt ``Labour'' -LRB-Labor cabinet minister King O'Malley dropped the `u' in 1912 to ``modernise'' it as per American English-RRB- and the advertisement alleged that South Australia's hospital waiting lists were the worst in the nation, which Labor successfully disputed to the Electoral Commissioner. During the election campaign, David Pisoni, the Liberal candidate for Unley, made allegations in his advertising that Labor and the Labor candidate Michael Keenan supported controversial urban infill programmes, which Labor flatly denied. Electoral Commissioner Kay Mousley investigated and ordered that the advertisements be withdrawn and corrections be run at Pisoni's expense. The Labor minority government sought to win a majority in the House of Assembly. Opinion polls indicated that this was likely and ABC elections expert Antony Green said that the ``Labor government looks set to be returned with an increased majority''. Centrebet had Labor at $1.01 AUD and the Liberals at $12.00 AUD for a majority government. Most commentators agreed that the Liberal Party had little chance of winning government, and that Kerin would step down from the leadership after the election, a suspicion confirmed in Kerin's concession speech. Martin Hamilton-Smith was considering mounting a leadership challenge, however, he withdrew on 14 October 2005 -LRB-probably for the sake of the impression of party unity-RRB- and subsequently resigned or was pushed from the opposition frontbench. -LSB-edit-RSB- Issues One of the most publicised issues prior to the election was the tram extension from Victoria Square to the Adelaide Railway Station which the Liberals, despite having proposed the idea in their previous transport plan, now opposed. Construction began in April 2007 and was operational as of October 2007. The Adelaide Airport expansion suffered fuel delivery related delays that Labor was criticised for. Continued delays by Labor to improve the safety of the Britannia roundabout were focused on by the Norwood Liberal candidate. Land and payroll tax cuts worth $1.5 billion were announced by Labor, the largest in the state's history. The tax cuts coincided with South Australia achieving an economic ``Triple A'' rating under the current Labor government. Business SA chief executive Peter Vaughan ``praised'' Labor's economic management. The construction of two bridges over Port River as part of the Port Expressway project had come under criticism,-LSB-citation needed-RSB- which the Government promised would be open-span to allow passage of tugboats and tall ships, thereby preserving the inner harbour's dwindling port functions. Despite criticism coming from the electorate, the media, federal Labor, and road organisations including the Royal Automobile Association-LSB-citation needed-RSB-, The Advertiser revealed details of ``the biggest project of its kind in South Australia's history'', a $1.5 billion redevelopment on the western bank of the inner harbour. The development will include 2000 new homes on government-owned land and new buildings as high as 12 storeys. This followed the awarding of a $6 billion air warfare destroyer contract to the Australian Submarine Corporation, based in the electorate at Osborne. The future of the River Murray has come under threat due to falling water levels, and in an unprecedented move, Nationals MP Karlene Maywald was given a cabinet position as Minister for the River Murray in 2004. Possible nuclear waste dumps were of concern to many Adelaide residents; Premier Rann successfully lobbied against any federal government proposals. Law and order was another key issue, with Labor promising extra police. Tough drink and drug driving laws had also been introduced which included zero tolerance roadside testing for Tetrahydrocannabinol -LRB-THC-RRB- and Methamphetamine, and later MDMA. Labor introduced speed limit reduction legislation which took effect in March 2003 which saw non-arterial non-main roads and most Adelaide CBD roads reduce from 60�km/h to 50�km/h. The Liberals proposed to increase the speed limit back to 60�km/h for several roads, concentrated mainly around the Adelaide Park Lands. Allegations were made over the condition of the state's health system and the capacity to deal with mental health issues. Labor pledged to buy back Modbury Hospital located in the district of Florey, privatised under the Liberal government to alleviate the effect of the State Bank collapse. The need for homosexual law reform was acknowledged by both major parties; however, there was disquiet within the Labor Party over delays. December 2006 saw the Domestic Partners bill pass which provides greater recognition to same sex relationships on a range of issues such as superannuation. The bill was supported by all parties after much negotiation, but in the end was voted against by both members of Family First, as well as Liberal Terry Stephens. Electoral reform policies received little attention, as has the 2010 referendum proposed by the Rann Government to abolish or reform the Legislative Council. WorkCover underfunded liability increases have also received little attention, despite the fact that the liability has climbed from a disputed $67 to $85 million to $700 million since Labor came in to government in 2002 due to a more generous compensation scheme. Labor have since looked in to reform for the scheme including cutting payments to injured workers. There were claims that federal industrial relations reform, WorkChoices, was an influential issue in the election. The Liberals announced 4,000 public service job cuts to pay for election promises. -LSB-edit-RSB- Polling Newspoll polling is conducted via random telephone number selection in city and country areas. Roy Morgan polling is conducted face-to-face Australia-wide. Sampling sizes consist of 500--1000 electors, Roy Morgan has a sampling tolerance -LRB-the Margin of error-RRB- of ±3.2 percent for a 40 to 60 percent rating in a sample size of 1000 electors, and ±4.5 for 500 electors. The sampling tolerance rate is lower for high and low percentages. -LSB-edit-RSB- Results -LSB-edit-RSB- House of Assembly The final results for the House of Assembly seats were 28 Labor, 15 Liberal, three independents and one National. First preference and two party preferred statistics for each district are available through the South Australian House of Assembly electoral districts article. Labor won six of eight key seats, the Liberals one of three key seats. Labor's wins included the previously marginal Liberal seats of Hartley, Light, Morialta, Mawson, Bright and Newland. The Liberals regained Peter Lewis' seat of Hammond. National Karlene Maywald and Independents Bob Such, Rory McEwen and Kris Hanna were all re-elected. Hanna was elected at the 2002 election as a Labor candidate; this counted as a loss for Labor, giving Labor a net gain of five seats. Labor, the Liberals and the Greens ran in all 47 seats, the Democrats ran in all but Giles which resulted in a contested seat vote of three percent, Family First ran in all but Ramsay and Croydon with a contested seat vote of 6.1 percent, with the Nationals running in Chaffey, Flinders, Finniss, and MacKillop, with a subsequent contested seat vote of 24.8 percent. Dignity for Disabled ran in ten seats, No Rodeo in seven seats, and One Nation in six seats. Jack Snelling became speaker of the House of Assembly. -LSB-edit-RSB- Key Liberal seats The outer southern suburbs district of Mawson was first won by former Liberal Police Minister Robert Brokenshire in the 1993 state election. He was defeated by Labor candidate and former radio presenter Leon Bignell who received a 5.7 percent two party preferred swing. The other outer suburbs district that fell to Labor was Bright, which was held since 1989 by former Liberal energy minister Wayne Matthew. Matthew decided to retire at this election; subsequently the seat was contested for the Liberals by Legislative Council member Angus Redford. Redford faced a tougher fight than expected and was defeated by Labor candidate Chloe Fox who received a huge 14.4 percent swing on a two party preferred basis, the largest in the state. The inner southern suburbs district of Unley was won in 2002 by outspoken Liberal Mark Brindal who failed to win Liberal preselection for the seat in the lead up to the 2006 election and attempted to gain backing to contest the marginal Labor seat of Adelaide, but was shrouded in a controversy concerning a sexual relationship that Brindal had with a mentally ill man. The Liberal candidate was businessman David Pisoni, while the Labor candidate was Unley Mayor Michael Keenan, who received a 7.9 percent two party preferred swing, narrowly missing out on picking up the seat by 1.1 percent. The inner north eastern suburbs district of Hartley had been won by Joe Scalzi in 1993 and held by a very narrow margin in each election since. The district has a very high proportion of Italian migrants and the ability to speak Italian is considered by many commentators as vital to win the seat and was a factor in Labor's preselection of political staffer Grace Portolesi. Portolesi defeated Scalzi with a 5.9 percent two party preferred swing. The neighbouring district of Morialta was held before this election by former Liberal Tourism Minister Joan Hall since 1993. She was defeated by Labor candidate Lindsay Simmons. Simmons received a 12 percent two party preferred swing, with Labor winning the seat for the first time since 1975. In the outer north-east, the district of Newland had been won by Liberal Dorothy Kotz since 1989, but after her decision to retire, the Liberal Party preselected police officer and local councillor Mark Osterstock. He was defeated by Labor candidate Tom Kenyon, who won the seat with a 12.5 percent two party preferred swing. In Light, which contains Gawler and the outer northern suburbs, was recontested by sitting Liberal member and former Education Minister Malcolm Buckby. He was defeated by Labor candidate and Gawler Mayor Tony Piccolo, who received a 4.9 percent two party preferred swing. This seat fell to Labor for the first time since 1944. The rural and outback district of Stuart was first won in 1997 by Liberal Graham Gunn, a former Speaker and Australia's longest currently serving parliamentarian -LRB-the longest being Billy Hughes at 51 years-RRB-. As in 2002, he was challenged by Labor ministerial adviser Justin Jarvis. Unlike the Adelaide metropolitan area and the neighbouring seat of Giles, there was only a small swing of 0.7 percent to Labor, subsequently Gunn managed to hang on with a margin of 0.6 percent. -LSB-edit-RSB- Key Labor seats The inner eastern suburbs district of Norwood, held for Labor by former Norwood mayor Vini Ciccarello, was expected to be a tough contest, particularly after the Liberal preselection of former Adelaide Crows footballer Nigel Smart. Ciccarello retained the seat picking up a 3.7 percent swing on the two party preferred vote. The other Labor seat considered under possible threat was the neighbouring inner city district of Adelaide where high profile Education Minister and former Lord Mayor Jane Lomax-Smith was challenged by Liberal Diana Carroll. Lomax-Smith comprehensively defeated Carroll with a 9.2 percent swing to Labor on the two-party preferred vote. -LSB-edit-RSB- Key Independent seats The southern suburbs district of Mitchell was won at the 2002 election by Kris Hanna, who was a Labor member. After the election, Hanna left Labor to join the Greens and subsequently left the Greens to become an independent on 8 February 2006. Hanna faced a tough contest to hold his seat against a challenge by Labor's Rosemary Clancy. Despite expectations before the election of a safe Labor win, Hanna defeated the Labor candidate by 0.6 percent of the vote with the aid of Liberal preferences. The district of Fisher, located in Adelaide's south, was held by independent MP Dr Bob Such. Late in the campaign, there was some speculation that Fisher may have been a closer contest than commentators initially expected, but Such comfortably defeated both Labor candidate Amanda Rishworth and Liberal candidate Andy Minnis with an independent candidate election best 45.2 percent of the primary vote, picking up a 4.6 percent two party preferred swing. The election outcome saw Such facing the Labor candidate on the two party preferred vote as opposed to the Liberal candidate in 2002. The Riverland based district of Chaffey is the only seat in South Australia held by a Nationals SA member. River Murray Minister Karlene Maywald won comfortably against a challenge by Liberal Anna Baric. Maywald received a 3.2 percent swing on the two party preferred vote. The Murray Bridge based district of Hammond was won in 2002 by independent MP Peter Lewis who cut a deal after the 2002 election which delivered government to Labor. Facing almost certain defeat in Hammond, he declined to recontest the district and failed in his attempt to win a seat in the Legislative Council. Hammond was won comfortably by Liberal Adrian Pederick. The district of Mount Gambier -LRB-which also includes much of South Australia's south east-RRB- was a close contest between independent and Agriculture Minister Rory McEwen and Liberal Peter Gandolfi. McEwen prevailed despite a 20.4 percent swing against him on the two party preferred vote. -LSB-edit-RSB- Post-election pendulum The following pendulum is known as the Mackerras Pendulum, invented by psephologist Malcolm Mackerras. The pendulum works by lining up all of the seats held in the House of Assembly according to the percentage point margin they are held by on a two party preferred basis. This is also known as the swing required for the seat to change hands. Given a uniform swing to the opposition or government parties, the number of seats that change hands can be predicted. Marginal 0--5.99 percent, Fairly Safe 6--10 percent, Safe >10 percent. -LSB-edit-RSB- Legislative Council In the South Australian Legislative Council, Labor won 4 seats, the Liberals won 3 seats, both No Pokies member Nick Xenophon and his running mate Ann Bressington were elected and Family First and the Greens won a seat each. Almost 40 percent of voters deserted the major parties for Nick Xenophon and the minor parties; this percentage had been steadily increasing over time. Labor received a 3.7 percent swing, electing four councillors as in the previous election. Carmel Zollo, Bob Sneath, Russell Wortley and Ian Hunter were all elected, with 4.39 quotas Bob Sneath was elected president of the Legislative Council. On the other hand, the Liberal vote collapsed with a 14.1 percent swing against the Liberal Party. Having received five councillors in 2002, at this election the Liberal Party had just three councillors elected. Rob Lucas, John Dawkins and Michelle Lensink were elected on 3.12 quotas. Before the election, No Pokies member Nick Xenophon was popular with the media and in opinion polls, but he faced a tough campaign as a result of both major parties preferencing in favour of other independents and the minor parties. No Pokies received 20.5 percent of the vote, yielding 2.46 quotas, which translated into seats for both Xenophon and his running mate Ann Bressington. Having been elected at the 1997 election with 2.9 percent of the vote and other independent candidates at the 2002 election on 1.3 percent of the vote -LRB-Xenophon being a sitting member at that election-RRB-, the No Pokies ticket received a swing of 19.2 percent. The Family First Party's first member, Andrew Evans MLC, was elected in 2002. Family First won 5 percent of the upper house vote with only a small swing of 0.98 percent, with candidate Dennis Hood being elected on preferences. The SA Greens won 4.3 percent of the upper house vote meaning a swing of 1.5 percent, narrowly securing Mark Parnell for the last upper house seat on preferences. This is the first time The Greens have won a seat in South Australia. Having secured second spot on the ticket at this election, Sarah Hanson-Young was successful in gaining the first spot on the ticket at the 2007 federal election, which saw the Greens secure their first federal upper house seat in South Australia. The Australian Democrats fell to just one seat in the Legislative Council held by Sandra Kanck, after Kate Reynolds was defeated in her bid for re-election after being appointed in 2003. The Democrats gained only 1.8 percent of the upper house vote after a 5.5 percent swing against them. Kanck has since announced that she will not recontest her seat at the next election, placing serious clouds over the future of the party in the state. Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party gained 0.8 percent of the upper house vote and won none of the six lower house seats they contested. Their highest vote was 4.1 percent in the district of Hammond, followed by 2.7 percent in Goyder, and the other four hovering around 1 percent. Dignity for Disabled ran for the first time and won 0.6 percent of the upper house vote; they won none of the 10 lower house seats they contested. Their best results were Wright as well as Bright, with 2.4 percent in each -LRB-506 and 492 votes respectively-RRB-. Labor-turned-independent Terry Cameron and Liberal-turned-independent Peter Lewis both failed in their bids for re-election. -LSB-edit-RSB- Legacy After the election, Rob Kerin vacated the position of opposition leader. The party selected conservative Iain Evans -LRB-son of former politician Stan Evans-RRB- for the role, with moderate Vickie Chapman -LRB-daughter of former politician Ted Chapman-RRB- as deputy leader. The only other contestant had been Isobel Redmond, who ran because she was concerned by some speculation that the Evans deal may have been stitched up by federal Liberal counterparts Christopher Pyne and Nick Minchin. Preferred premier ratings in July 2006 showed Rann on 71 percent with Evans on 15 percent. Only 27 percent of Liberal Party supporters saw Evans as the preferred premier. Continuing low support for the new Liberal leadership saw Martin Hamilton-Smith replace Evans in April 2007, however this move saw Liberal support decline further to a three-year low according to an Advertiser poll conducted a month after the leadership change. Over half of polling respondents were unable to name the leader of the Liberal Party. This contradicted Newspolls quarterly polling indicating the Rann Labor government slipping to a two-party preferred figure of 57 percent down four percent, with a preferred premier rating of 52 percent down 14 percent for Rann and a first-time rating of 21 percent for Martin Hamilton-Smith. Poll results also show Rann's satisfaction rating was below 60 percent for the first time since coming to office at 58 percent, with Hamilton-Smith receiving a 33 percent satisfaction rate. Previously unknown quantity Ann Bressington, elected on the back of Nick Xenophon's No Pokies popularity, has proposed mainly conservative policies such as raising the legal drinking age from 18 to 21, zero tolerance of illicit drugs, mandatory twice-annual drug tests of every South Australian school student over the age of 14 regardless of whether parents give their consent, and making the sale of ``drug-taking equipment'' illegal. However, she remains undecided on voluntary euthanasia, calling it ``a personal struggle''. Setting a precedent, Sandra Kanck's pro-euthanasia speech which contained suicide methods was censored from the internet version of Hansard in August 2006 as a result of an upper house motion, with Labor, Family First, Nick Xenophon and Ann Bressington voting for, and the Liberals and SA Greens member Mark Parnell voting against. Despite this, the speech was published on a non-Australian website. The state's budget was released on 21 September 2006. It included 1,600 public service job axings despite an election pledge of only 400, however none of the redundancies will be forced. It also included increases in some fees and charges such as victims of crime levies and Technical and Further Education -LRB-TAFE-RRB- charges. There were increases in funding for health, schools, police and prisons, and the Department of Public Prosecutions. The 2007--2008 budget released on 13 June 2007 saw additional spending on Transport, Energy and Infrastructure, Health, Families and Communities, and Justice portfolios such as transport initiatives including revitalisation of the rail network, commencement of the $1.7 billion Marjorie Jackson-Nelson Hospital to replace the Royal Adelaide Hospital, funding for mental health reform including the delivery of health services, and funding for new commitments to law and order policies. No Pokies MP Nick Xenophon resigned from parliament in early October 2007 in a successful attempt to win a seat in the Australian Senate at the 2007 federal election, which according to the South Australian result, he retained 72 percent of his 2006 vote, on 14.78 percent. His replacement is his third candidate on the 2006 ticket, former Valuer-General John Darley, and was appointed by a joint sitting on 21 November 2007, where second candidate and upper house MP Ann Bressington also took the opportunity to slam Nick Xenophon, accusing him of lacking integrity and suitability for federal parliament. A record-breaking 13-hour Parnell-Bressington filibuster occurred in May 2008 in crossbench opposition to WorkCover cuts being passed by the major parties due to the increasing underfunded liability in the workers' compensation scheme. However, by this time, Labor had already gained the support of independents Bob Such and Rory McEwen in 2002, as well as Nationals SA member Karlene Maywald in 2004. -LSB-edit-RSB- Legislative Council In the South Australian Legislative Council, Labor won 4 seats, the Liberals won 3 seats, both No Pokies member Nick Xenophon and his running mate Ann Bressington were elected and Family First and the Greens won a seat each.

Historian Raymond Thorp gave his birth date as April 10, but Thorp did not provide any documentation for that date. Bowie was the ninth of ten�children born to Elve Ap-Catesby Jones and Rezin Bowie. His father had been injured while fighting in the American Revolution, and in 1782 married the young woman who had nursed him back to health. The Bowies moved frequently, first settling in Georgia, before moving to Kentucky. At the time of Bowie's birth, his father owned eight slaves, eleven head of cattle, seven horses, and one stud horse. The following year the family acquired 200�acres -LRB-80�ha-RRB- along the Red River. They sold that property in 1800 and relocated to Missouri before moving to Spanish Louisiana in 1802, where they settled on Bushley Bayou in Rapides Parish. The Bowie family moved again in 1809, settling on Bayou Teche in Louisiana before finding a permanent home in Opelousas in 1812. The Bowie children were raised on the frontier and even as small children were expected to help clear the land and plant crops. All of the Bowie children learned to read and write in English, but Jim and his elder brother Rezin could also read, write, and speak Spanish and French fluently. The children learned to survive on the frontier, how to fish and run a farm and plantation. Jim Bowie became proficient with pistol, rifle, and knife, and had a reputation for fearlessness. As a boy one of his Indian friends even taught him to rope alligators. In response to Andrew Jackson's plea for volunteers to fight the British in the War of 1812, Bowie and his brother Rezin enlisted in the Louisiana militia in late 1814. The war ended on December 24 of that year with the signing of the Treaty of Ghent, and the Bowie brothers arrived in New Orleans too late to participate in the fighting. After mustering out of the militia, Bowie settled in Rapides Parish, where he supported himself by sawing planks and lumber and floating it down the bayou for sale. In June 1819, he joined the Long expedition, an effort to liberate Texas from Spanish rule. The group encountered little resistance and, after capturing Nacogdoches, declared Texas an independent republic. The extent of Bowie's participation is unclear, but he returned to Louisiana before the invasion was repelled by Spanish troops. -LSB-edit-RSB- Land speculator Shortly before their father died in 1818 or 1819, he gave ten�slaves, and horses and cattle to both Jim and his brother Rezin. For the next seven�years the brothers worked together to develop several large estates in Lafourche Parish and Opelousas. Louisiana's population was growing rapidly, and the brothers hoped to take advantage of its rising land prices through speculation. Without the capital required to buy large tracts, they entered into a partnership with a pirate, Jean Lafitte, in 1818 to raise money. By then, the United States had outlawed the importation of slaves, and most southern states allowed anyone who informed on a slave trader to receive half of what the imported slaves would earn at auction as a reward. Bowie made three�trips to Lafitte's compound on Galveston Island. On each occasion he bought smuggled slaves and then took them directly to a customhouse to inform on his own actions. When the customs officers offered the slaves for auction, Bowie purchased them and received back half the price he had paid, as allowed by the state laws. He then could legally transport the slaves and resell them at a greater market value in New Orleans or areas farther up the Mississippi River. Using this scheme the brothers collected $65,000 to be used for their land speculation. In 1825, the two brothers joined with their younger brother Stephen to buy Acadia, a plantation near Alexandria. Within two�years they had established the first steam mill in Louisiana to be used for grinding sugar cane. The plantation became known as a model estate, but, on February 12, 1831, they sold it and 65�slaves for $90,000. With their profits, Bowie and Rezin bought a plantation in Arkansas. Bowie and his brother John were involved in a major court case in the late 1820s over their land speculation. When the United States purchased the Louisiana Territory in 1803, it promised to honor all former land grant claims, and for the next 20�years efforts were made to establish who owned what land. In May 1824, Congress authorized the superior courts of each territory to hear suits from people who claimed they had been overlooked. The Arkansas Superior Court received 126�claims in late 1827 from residents who claimed to have purchased land in former Spanish grants from the Bowie brothers. Although the Superior Court originally confirmed most of those claims, the decisions were reversed in February 1831, after further research showed that the land had never belonged to the Bowies, and that the original land grant documentation had been forged. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the reversal in 1833. When the disgruntled purchasers considered suing the Bowies, they discovered that the documents in the case had been removed from the court; left without evidence, they declined to pursue a case. -LSB-edit-RSB- Bowie knife Bowie became internationally famous as a result of a feud with Norris Wright, the sheriff of Rapides Parish. Bowie had supported Wright's opponent in the race for sheriff, and Wright, a bank director, had been instrumental in turning down Bowie's loan application. After a confrontation in Alexandria one afternoon, Wright fired a shot at Bowie. The uninjured Bowie was enraged and tried to kill Wright with his bare hands. Wright's friends intervened and stopped the attack, after which Bowie resolved to carry his hunting knife at all times. The knife he carried had a huge blade that was 9.25�inches -LRB-23.5�cm-RRB- long and 1.5�inches -LRB-3.8�cm-RRB- wide. The following year, on September 19, 1827, Bowie and Wright attended a duel on a sandbar outside of Natchez, Mississippi. Bowie supported duelist Samuel Levi Wells III, while Wright supported Wells's opponent, Dr. Thomas Harris Maddox. The duelists each fired two�shots, and, as neither man had been injured, resolved their duel with a handshake. Other members of the groups, who had various reasons for disliking each other, began fighting. Bowie was shot in the hip; after regaining his feet he drew a knife, described as a butcher knife, and charged his attacker. The attacker hit Bowie over the head with his empty pistol, breaking the pistol and knocking Bowie to the ground. Wright shot at and missed the prone Bowie, who returned fire and possibly, hit Wright. Wright then drew his sword cane and impaled Bowie. When Wright attempted to retrieve his blade by placing his foot on Bowie's chest and tugging, Bowie pulled him down and disemboweled Wright with his large knife. Wright died instantly, and Bowie, with Wright's sword still protruding from his chest, was shot again and stabbed by another member of the group. The doctors who had been present for the duel retrieved the bullets and patched Bowie's other wounds. Newspapers picked up the story, which became known as the Sandbar Fight, and described in detail Bowie's fighting prowess and his unusual knife. Witness accounts agreed that Bowie did not attack first, and the others had focused their attack on Bowie because ``they considered him the most dangerous man among their opposition.'' The fight cemented Bowie's reputation across the South as a superb knife-fighter. There is disagreement among scholars as to whether the knife used in this fight was the same kind of knife now known as a Bowie knife. Multiple accounts exist of who designed and built the first Bowie knife. Some claim that Bowie designed it, while others attribute the design to noted knife makers of the time. However, in a letter to The Planter's Advocate, Rezin Bowie claimed to have invented the knife, and many Bowie family members as well as ``most authorities on the Bowie knife tend to believe it was invented by'' Rezin. Rezin Bowie's grandchildren, however, claimed that Rezin merely supervised his blacksmith, who was the creator of the knife. After the Sandbar Fight and subsequent battles in which Bowie successfully used his knife to defend himself, the Bowie knife became very popular. Many craftsmen and manufacturers made their own versions, and major cities of the Southwest had ``Bowie knife schools'', which taught ``the art of cut, thrust, and parry.'' His fame, and that of his knife, spread to England, and by the early 1830s many British manufacturers were producing Bowie knives for shipment to the United States. The design of the knife continued to evolve, but today a Bowie knife generally is considered to have a blade 8.25�inches -LRB-21.0�cm-RRB- long and 1.25�inches -LRB-3.2�cm-RRB- wide, with a curved point, a ``sharp false edge cut from both sides'', and a cross-guard to protect the user's hands. -LSB-edit-RSB- Establishment in Texas After recovering from the wounds he suffered in the Sandbar Fight, in 1828 Bowie decided to move to Texas, at that time a state in the Mexican federation. The 1824 Constitution of Mexico banned religions other than Roman Catholicism and gave preference to Mexican citizens in receiving land. Bowie was baptized into the Roman Catholic faith in San Antonio on April 28, 1828, sponsored by the alcalde -LRB-chief administrator-RRB- of the town, Juan Martin de Veramendi and the wife of the administrator, Josefa Navarro. For the next eighteen�months Bowie travelled through Louisiana and Mississippi. In 1829, he became engaged to Cecilia Wells, who died in Alexandria on September 29, two�weeks before their wedding. On January 1, 1830, Bowie left Louisiana for permanent residency in Texas. He stopped at Nacogdoches, at Jared E. Groce's farm on the Brazos River, and in San Felipe, where Bowie presented a letter of introduction to Stephen F. Austin from Thomas F. McKinney, one of the Old Three Hundred colonists. On February 20, Bowie took an oath of allegiance to Mexico and then proceeded to San Antonio de Bexar. At the time the city, known as Bexar, had a population of 2,500�people, mostly of Mexican descent, and Bowie's fluency in Spanish helped him establish himself in the area. Bowie was elected a commander of the Texas Rangers later that year. Although the Rangers would not be organized officially until 1835, Stephen F. Austin had founded the group by employing thirty�men to keep the peace and protect the colonists from attacks by hostile Indians. Other areas assembled similar volunteer militias, and Bowie commanded a group of the volunteers. Bowie became a Mexican citizen on September 30, 1830, after promising to establish textile mills in the province of Coahuila y Tejas. To fulfill his promise, Bowie entered into partnership with Veramendi to build cotton and wool mills in Saltillo. With his citizenship assured, Bowie now had the right to buy up to 11�leagues of public land. He convinced fourteen or fifteen other citizens to apply for land in order to turn it over to him, giving him 700,000�acres -LRB-280,000�ha-RRB- for speculation. Bowie may have been the first to induce settlers to apply for empresario grants which could then be sold in bulk to speculators like Bowie. The Mexican government passed laws in 1834 and 1835 that stopped much of the land speculation. On April 25, 1831 Bowie married 19-year-old Maria Ursula de Veramendi, the daughter of his business partner, who had become the vice-governor of the province. Several days before the ceremony he signed a dowry contract, promising to pay his new bride 15,000�pesos -LRB-approximately $15,000-RRB- in cash or property within two�years of the marriage. At the time Bowie claimed to have a net worth of $223,000, mostly in land of questionable title. Bowie also lied about his age, claiming to be 30 rather than 35. The couple built a house in San Antonio, on land Veramendi had given them near the San José Mission. After a short time, however, they moved into the Veramendi Palace, living with Ursula's parents, who supplied them with spending money. The couple had two�children, Marie Elve, born March 20, 1832, and James Veramendi, born July 18, 1833. -LSB-edit-RSB- San Saba Mine Shortly after his marriage Bowie became fascinated with the story of the ``lost'' Los Almagres Mine, said to be west of San Antonio near the ruin of Santa Cruz de San Sabá Mission. The mine had been operated by local Indians before being seized by the Spanish. After Mexico won independence from Spain, government interest in the mines waned. A number of hostile Indian tribes roamed the area, including Comanche, Lipan Apache, and Karankawa, and without government troops to keep the tribes at bay, mining ceased. It was believed that after the Mexican citizens left the area, the Lipan Apaches took over the mines. After obtaining permission from the Mexican government to mount an expedition into Indian territory to search for the legendary silver mine, Bowie, his brother Rezin, and nine�others set out for San Saba on November 2, 1831. Six�miles -LRB-10�km-RRB- from their goal, the group stopped to negotiate with a large Indian raiding party following them. The attempts at parley failed and Bowie and his group fought for their lives for the next 13�hours. When the Indians finally retreated, Bowie reportedly had lost only one�man, while over 40�Indians had been killed and 30 more wounded. In the meantime, a party of friendly Comanche Indians rode into San Antonio, bringing word of the raiding party, which outnumbered the Bowie expedition by 15--to--1. The citizens of San Antonio believed the members of the Bowie expedition must have perished, and Ursula Bowie began wearing widow's weeds. To the surprise of the town, the surviving members of the group returned to San Antonio on December 6. Bowie's report of the expedition, written in Spanish, was printed in several newspapers, further establishing his reputation. He set out again with a larger force the following month, but returned home empty-handed after two and a half months of searching. Bowie never talked of his exploits despite his increasing fame. Captain William Y. Lacey, who spent eight�months living in the wilderness with Bowie, described him as a humble man who never used profanity or vulgarities. -LSB-edit-RSB- Texas Revolution -LSB-edit-RSB- Texian rumblings Between 1830 and 1832 the Mexican Congress passed a series of laws that seemed to discriminate against Anglo colonists in the province of Coahuila y Tejas, increasing tension between the Anglo citizenry and Mexican officials. In response to the rumblings, Mexican troops established military posts in several locations within the province, including San Antonio de Béxar. Although much of the military supported the administration of President Anastasio Bustamante, Antonio López de Santa Anna led an insurrection against him in 1832. Anglo colonists in Texas supported Santa Anna and General José Antonio Mexía, who led soldiers into Texas to oust commanders loyal to Bustamante. After hearing that the Mexican army commander in Nacogdoches, José de las Piedras, had demanded that all residents in his area surrender their arms, Bowie cut short a visit to Natchez in July 1832 to return to Texas. On August 2, 1832, he joined a group of other Texians and marched into Nacogdoches to ``present their demands'' to Piedras. Before the group reached the building housing the town officials, they were attacked by a force of 100�Mexican cavalry. The Texians returned fire and, after the cavalry retreated, initiated a siege of the garrison. After a second battle in which Piedras lost 33�men, the Mexican army evacuated during the night. Bowie and eighteen�companions ambushed the fleeing army and, after Piedras fled, marched the soldiers back to Nacogdoches. Bowie later served as a delegate to the Convention of 1833, which formally requested that Texas become its own state within the Mexican federation. Several months later, a cholera epidemic struck Texas. Fearing the disease would reach San Antonio, Bowie sent his pregnant wife and their daughter to the family estate in Monclova in the company of her parents and brother. The cholera epidemic instead struck Monclova, and between September 6 and September 14, Ursula, their children, her brother, and her parents all died of the disease. Bowie, on business in Natchez, heard of his family's deaths in November. From then on, he drank heavily and became ``careless in his dress''. The following year the Mexican government passed new laws allowing land sale in Texas, and Bowie returned to land speculation. He was appointed as a land commissioner, tasked with promoting settlement in the area purchased by John T. Mason. His appointment ended in May 1835, when President Antonio López de Santa Anna abolished the Coahuila y Tejas government and ordered the arrest of all Texians -LRB-including Bowie-RRB- doing business in Monclova. Bowie was forced to flee Monclova and return to the Anglo areas of Texas. The Anglos in Texas began agitating for war against Santa Anna, and Bowie worked with William B. Travis, the leader of the War Party, to gain support. Bowie visited several Indian villages in East Texas in an attempt to convince the reluctant tribes to fight against the Mexican government. Santa Anna responded to the rumblings by ordering large numbers of Mexican troops to Texas. -LSB-edit-RSB- Battle of Concepción The Texas Revolution began on October 2, 1835 with the Battle of Gonzales. Stephen F. Austin formed an army of 500�men to march on the Mexican forces in San Antonio with the cannon that had precipitated the fight. On October 22, Austin asked Bowie, now a colonel in the volunteer militia, and James W. Fannin to scout the area around the missions of San Francisco de la Espada and San José y San Miguel de Aguayo to find supplies for the volunteer forces. The scouting party left with 92�men, many of them members of the New Orleans Grays who had just arrived in Texas. After discovering a good defensive position near Mission Concepción, the group requested that Austin's army join them. On the foggy morning of October 28, Mexican General Domingo Ugartechea led a force of 300�infantry and cavalry soldiers and 2 small cannons against the Texian forces. Although the Mexican army was able to get within 200�yards -LRB-183�m-RRB-, the Texian defensive position protected them from fire. As the Mexicans stopped to reload their cannon, the Texians climbed a bluff and picked off some of the soldiers. The stalemate ended shortly after Bowie led a charge to seize one of the Mexican cannons, at that time only 80�yards -LRB-73�m-RRB- away. Ugartechea retreated with his troops, ending the Battle of Concepción. One�Texian and ten�Mexican troops had been killed. One of the men under Bowie's command during the battle later praised him ``as a born leader, never needlessly spending a bullet or imperiling a life, who repeatedly admonished ... Keep under cover boys, and reserve your fire; we haven't a man to spare.'' -LSB-edit-RSB- Grass Fight and commission difficulties An hour after the battle ended, Austin arrived with the rest of the Texian army to begin a siege of San Antonio de Béxar, where General Martín Perfecto de Cós, the overall commander of Mexican forces in Texas, and his troops were garrisoned. Two�days later, Bowie resigned from Austin's army because he did not have an official commission in the army, and he disliked the ``minor tasks of scouting and spying''. On November 3, 1835, Texas declared itself an independent state, and a provisional government was formed with Henry Smith of Brazoria elected provisional governor. Austin requested to be relieved of his command of the army, and Sam Houston was named army chief. Edward Burleson was chosen as temporary commander of the troops in San Antonio. Bowie appeared before the council at some point and spoke for an hour, asking for a commission. The council refused Bowie's request, likely because of lingering animosity over his land dealings. Houston offered Bowie a commission as an officer on his staff, but Bowie rejected the opportunity, explaining that he wanted to be in the midst of the fighting. Instead, Bowie enlisted in the army as a private under Fannin. He distinguished himself again in the Grass Fight on November 26. Cós had sent 100�soldiers to cut grass for the horses. As they returned to San Antonio, Bowie took 60�mounted men to intercept the party, which they believed carried valuable cargo. The Mexican troops quickened their pace in the hopes of reaching the safety of the city, but Bowie and his cavalry chased them. At the end of the fight, the Texians had two�wounded men, but had captured many horses and mules. Shortly after Bowie left San Antonio, Ben Milam led an assault on the city. In the ensuing fighting, the Texians suffered only a few casualties, while the Mexican army lost many troops to death and desertion. Cós surrendered and returned to Mexico, taking with him the last Mexican troops in Texas. Believing the war was over, many of the Texian volunteers left the army and returned to their families. In early January 1836, Bowie went to San Felipe and asked the council to allow him to recruit a regiment. He again was turned down, as he ``was not an officer of the government nor army.'' -LSB-edit-RSB- Battle at the Alamo After Houston received word that Santa Anna was leading a large force to San Antonio, Bowie offered to lead volunteers to defend the Alamo from the expected attack. He arrived with 30�men on January 19, where they found a force of 104�men with a few weapons and a few cannons, but little supplies and gunpowder. Houston knew that there were not enough men to hold the fort in an attack and had given Bowie orders to remove the artillery and blow up the fortification. Bowie and the Alamo captain, James C. Neill, decided they did not have enough oxen to move the artillery, and they did not want to destroy the fortress. On January 26, one of Bowie's men, James Bonham, organized a rally which passed a resolution in favor of holding the Alamo. Bonham signed the resolution first, with Bowie's signature second. Through Bowie's connections because of his marriage and his fluency in Spanish, the predominantly Mexican population of San Antonio often furnished him with information about the movements of the Mexican army. After learning that Santa Anna had 4,500�troops and was heading for the city, Bowie wrote several letters to the provisional government asking for help in defending the Alamo, especially ``men, money, rifles, and cannon powder''. In another letter, to Governor Smith, he reiterated his view that ``the salvation of Texas depends in great measure on keeping Bexar out of the hands of the enemy. It serves as the frontier picquet guard, and if it were in the possession of Santa Anna, there is no stronghold from which to repel him in his march toward the Sabine.'' The letter to Smith ended, ``Colonel Neill and myself have come to the solemn resolution that we will rather die in these ditches than give it up to the enemy.'' On February 3, William Travis arrived with an additional 30�troops, and several days later Davy Crockett appeared with twelve�Tennesseans. Neill went on furlough on February 17 to visit his sick family, leaving Travis, a member of the regular army, in command. Bowie was older than Travis with a better reputation and considered himself a colonel, thus outranking Travis, a major. He refused to answer to Travis, who called an election for the men to choose their own commander. They chose Bowie, infuriating Travis. Bowie celebrated his appointment by getting very drunk and causing havoc in San Antonio, releasing all prisoners in the local jails and harassing citizens. Travis was disgusted, but two�days later the men agreed to a joint command; Bowie would command the volunteers, and Travis would command the regular army and the volunteer cavalry. Fearing for the safety of his wife's relatives in San Antonio, Bowie invited her cousins Getrudis Navarro and Juana Navarro Alsbury, as well as Alsbury's 18-month-old son, Alijo, to stay inside the walls of the Alamo. Bowie had been ill, and two�doctors, including the fort surgeon, were unable to diagnose his illness. Travis became the sole commander of the forces when Bowie was confined to bed. Santa Anna and his army reached the outskirts of San Antonio de Bexar several days later and began a siege of the Alamo on February 24. The Mexican army raised a red flag to warn the defenders that no quarter would be given. Travis sent Juan Seguin to recruit reinforcements on February 25, and 32 additional men arrived. Thirty-five�years after the Alamo fell, a reporter identified Louis ``Moses'' Rose as the only man to have ``deserted'' the Texian forces at the Alamo. According to the reporter's version of Rose's account, when Travis realized that the Mexican army would likely prevail, he drew a line in the sand and asked those willing to die for the cause to cross the line. At Bowie's request Crockett and several others carried the cot over the line, leaving Rose alone on the other side. After its publication, several other eyewitnesses confirmed the account, but as Rose was deceased the story can only be authenticated by the word of the reporter, who admitted to embellishing other articles, ``and thus many historians refuse to believe it.'' Bowie perished with the rest of the Alamo defenders on March 6, when the Mexicans attacked. Most of the noncombatants in the fort, including Bowie's relatives, survived. Santa Anna ordered the alcalde of San Antonio, Francisco Antonio Ruiz, to confirm the identities of Bowie, Travis, and Crockett. After first ordering that Bowie be buried, as he was too brave a man to be burned like a dog, Santa Anna later had Bowie's body placed with those of the other Texians on the funeral pyre. When Bowie's mother was informed of his death, she calmly stated, ``I'll wager no wounds were found in his back.'' Various eyewitnesses to the battle gave conflicting accounts of Bowie's death. A newspaper article claimed that a Mexican soldier saw Bowie carried from his room on his cot, alive, after the conclusion of the battle. The soldier maintained that Bowie verbally castigated a Mexican officer in fluent Spanish, and the officer ordered Bowie's tongue cut out and his still-breathing body thrown onto the funeral pyre. This account has been disputed by numerous other witnesses, and it is thought to have been invented by the reporter. Other witnesses maintained that they saw several Mexican soldiers enter Bowie's room, bayonet him, and carry him, alive, from the room. Various other stories circulated, with some witnesses claiming that Bowie shot himself and others saying he was killed by soldiers while too weak to lift his head. Alcalde Ruiz said that Bowie was found ``dead in his bed.'' According to Wallace O Chariton, The ``most popular, and probably the most accurate'' version is that Bowie died on his cot, ``back braced against the wall, and using his pistols and his famous knife.'' One�year after the battle, Juan Seguin returned to the Alamo and gathered the remaining ashes from the funeral pyre. He placed these in a coffin inscribed with the names of Bowie, Travis, and Crockett. The ashes were interred at the Cathedral of San Fernando. -LSB-edit-RSB- Legacy Despite his continual pronouncements of wealth, Bowie's estate was found to be very small. His possessions were auctioned for only $99.50. His larger legacy is his position as ``one of the legendary characters of the American frontier''. Bowie left a ``frustratingly sparse paper trail'' of his life, and, for many, ``where history failed, the legends prevailed.'' Although Bowie's name and his knife were well-known during his lifetime, his legend grew after October 1852, when DeBow's Review published an article written by his brother John Jones Bowie, called ``Early Life in the Southwest--The Bowies.'' The article focused primarily on the exploits of Jim Bowie. Beginning with that article, ``romanticized stories'' about Bowie began appearing in national press. In many cases, ``these stories were pure melodrama, with Bowie rescuing some naïve planter's son or damsel in distress.'' Jim Bowie posthumously was inducted into the Blade Magazine Cutlery Hall of Fame at the 1988 Blade Show in Atlanta, Georgia in recognition for the impact that his eponymous design made upon generations of knife makers and cutlery companies. A number of films have depicted the events of the Battle of the Alamo, and Bowie has appeared as a character in each. From 1956--1958, Bowie was the subject of a television show, The Adventures of Jim Bowie, which was primarily set in 1830s Louisiana, although later episodes ventured into the Mexican province of Texas. The show, which starred Scott Forbes, was based on the 1946 novel Tempered Blade. Bowie also is the namesake of rock star David Bowie, who was born David Robert Jones. Jones changed his name in the 1960s because he feared his name was too similar to Davy Jones, a member of already famous The Monkees. He chose the surname Bowie because he admired James Bowie and the Bowie knife. Both Bowie, Texas and Bowie County, Texas are named in honor of Jim Bowie. Six�miles -LRB-10�km-RRB- from their goal, the group stopped to negotiate with a large Indian raiding party following them. When Wright attempted to retrieve his blade by placing his foot on Bowie's chest and tugging, Bowie pulled him down and disemboweled Wright with his large knife.

His death raised great hopes among the prisoners of amnesty or, failing that, prison reform, and this hope was further emboldened by the subsequent downfall of Stalin's right hand man and state security chief, Lavrenty Beria. Beria, who was the chief of the entire Soviet security and police apparatus and architect of some of the most hated policies relating to the camps, was declared an ``enemy of the people'' and executed by those who succeeded Stalin. Beria's newly besmirched name became a liability to others in both the upper and lower echelons of the Soviet hierarchy, and anybody who was associated with or spoke too much in favour of Beria was similarly at risk of being denounced as a traitor and persecuted. The camp administration were not excluded from this risk, and this fact in turn significantly weakened their position vis à vis the prisoners. Writing about the strikes which were taking place at the time, Solzhenitsyn described this issue: Prisoners all over gulag, for this reason and others, were becoming increasingly bold and impudent in the months preceding the uprising, with hunger strikes, work stoppages, large-scale insubordination, and punitive violence becoming more and more common. In Kengir in particular, camp authorities were rapidly losing all control over their charges, and the communiques periodically sent by commanders up the camp hierarchy, in which they expressed their horror at the frequent incidents of unrest, powerful underground organizations, the growing ``crisis'' afflicting their network of informants, and their desperate attempts to reassert control, attest to this. -LSB-edit-RSB- Kengir -LSB-edit-RSB- Thieves The uprising's roots can be traced back to a large in-shipment of ``thieves'' -- the accepted slang term for the habitual criminals who were also imprisoned in Gulag along with the political prisoners. Traditionally thieves and politicals had been antagonists, with the thieves exercising virtually unchecked dominance over the politicals, robbing and abusing them at will, and with the politicals remaining too disunited to muster a credible defense. This situation was facilitated by a variably complacent and actively encouraging camp administration, which recognized the potential of thieves as an effective means of suppressing the politicals and preventing them from uniting in a common cause. Indeed, the infusion of roughly 650 thieves into the roughly 8,000-strong body of political prisoners at Kengir at the beginning of May was specifically for this purpose, as the Kengir prisoners had organized strikes before on a smaller scale and were becoming increasingly restless. The camp authorities hoped that these thieves would, as they had in the past, help reverse this trend. -LSB-edit-RSB- Stoolies It is important to note that, while the Gulag labour camps were founded in the early 1920s, only in the early 1950s were the politicals and thieves finally separated into different camp systems. With the thieves out of the way, the politicals began to unite in ways unprecedented in Gulag. The building blocks of this process were national, religious, and ethnic groups -LRB-Ukrainians, Kazakhs, Chechens, Armenians, Estonians, Muslims, etc.-RRB- who quickly consolidated into strong groups and led the way towards the building of a camp-wide coalition, primarily by launching huge campaigns of murder against camp ``stoolies'' -LRB-or stool pigeons-RRB--- a widely used term for snitches or prisoners who otherwise colluded in any way with the camp administration. Along with the thieves, the stoolies were the primary impediment to the politicals uniting together in the past. The stoolies kept their identities secret, denounced fellow prisoners often, and worked assiduously to root out and finger potentially troublesome prisoners. Because of this, a massive chilling effect was created among prisoners, who feared opening up to or trusting each other. These national and ethnic blocks, though, began the fight against the stoolies, systematically fishing out and killing them with a vigour and efficiency so great that the remaining, unidentified stoolies fled to the camp administration for protection. -LSB-edit-RSB- Weaponry and organization Of these above mentioned ethnic blocks, the Ukrainians, many of whom were exiled members of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists -LRB-by some estimates making up over a half of the camps' population-RRB- were undoubtedly the most important, and they quickly asserted a leadership role amongst the prisoners. Members of this ``Ukrainian Centre'', as it was often called, were the primary proponents of stoolie extermination and later would prove essential to dealing with the newly-arrived thieves. Along with this effective elimination of stoolies, the prisoners began fashioning relatively high quality shivs, which were previously the exclusive territory of thieves. In addition, many incidents took place -LRB-usually including the wanton murder of some well-liked prisoners by guards-RRB- during the previous months that came to fuel resentment and justify extreme action on behalf of the prisoners. Protests and collective refusals to work were increasing in frequency and the prisoners were learning the ropes of how to plan and maintain large-scale disturbances, mainly by creating systems of communication between camp divisions and, more importantly, by establishing command hierarchies. Into this changed climate the thieves were injected and, to the surprise of the camp authorities, they instantly joined forces with the politicals, meeting secretly on the first night with the Ukrainian Centre and establishing a pact. This was due both to the fact that they recognized their odds against the almost 8,000 strong body of well-armed and united political prisoners, and because thieves across the whole Gulag caught wind of the politicals' campaign against the stoolies and began to admire and respect them. -LSB-edit-RSB- The camp compound The entire Kengir camp complex formed a large rectangle, divided up width-wise into four distinct areas: the women's camp, the ``service yard'', where all the workshops and storerooms were located, and two camps for men, each with its own jailhouse for punishing prisoners or hiding stoolies. The women's camp was blocked off both from access and sight to the mens' camp. -LSB-edit-RSB- Seizing of the camp The formative stage of the uprising began on the evening of 16 May, a Sunday and thus a day off for all the prisoners. The thieves contrived to break into the service yard, where all the food was stored, and from there break into the women's camp, which was easier to do from that location. This they initially did, but they were shortly chased off by guards. At nightfall, though, the thieves regrouped, shot out all of the lights in range with their slingshots, and broke through the barrier between the men's camp and service yard with an improvised battering ram. It was at this point the Kengir uprising proper started when the guards opened fire on the thieves, killing 13 and wounding 43. The remaining thieves retreated and an uneasy peace followed. During the night, though, thieves, now joined by the politicals, started breaking up their bunks and cells, trying to add to their cache of shivs and arm those without weapons, while the camp authorities posted machine gunners at the hole in the wall. After a tense standoff, the camp authorities, in a surprise gesture, ordered the withdrawal of all guards from the compound. Despite appearances, this was a strictly tactical move on the part of the authorities. The following day they feigned acquiescence to the prisoners demands and, while the prisoners then agreeably went off to work outside the camp, the guards busied themselves patching up the broken-down wall. Nevertheless this was a strategic error on their part because it exposed the bad faith of the guards and eliminated all remaining trust the prisoners had in their word. More importantly, though, the prisoners had, for one whole day, tasted total freedom -LRB-within the confines of the camp compound-RRB-, mingling freely with the female prisoners, eating their fill, and fraternizing as they pleased, and this put in them a desire for freedom that would not be so easily quenched. This time also saw the first propaganda offensive by the camp authorities -LRB-they re-enacted, in full prisoner costume, the alleged rape of the women prisoners and photographed themselves, releasing the photographs and declaring that the revolt was in fact a cover for debauchery and hedonism-RRB-, setting the tone for the many that would follow. After realizing these sleights of hand on the part of the camp authorities, the prisoners quickly and forcefully reasserted themselves, running amok and sending the guards fleeing from the camp again. They then proceeded to re-destroy the wall that had just been repaired and release the prisoners from the camp's solitary confinement cells. The camp had been seized and would remain in the control of the prisoners for the next 40 days. -LSB-edit-RSB- The new camp society -LSB-edit-RSB- Culture With the entire camp at their disposal, and with feelings of fellowship and good-will in abundance, prisoners took part in a hurried romp through the joys of normal, human, everyday life that had been denied to them for so long. As Solzhenitsyn and others retold, men and women from different camp divisions who had romantically conversed in secret for years, but had never seen each other, finally met. Imprisoned priests presided over a number of improvised weddings. Prisoners retrieved what remained of their civilian clothing from the storeroom -LRB-the guards regularly stole and sold prisoners' items-RRB-, and soon prisoners were seen adorned with fur coats and assorted colourful clothing, in addition to the religious wear that had been banned. Business, as well, resumed as best it could, with one Polish aristocrat opening up a ``café'' serving ersatz ``coffee'', which proved to be quite popular with the prisoners. In short order, a number of organized recreational activities also sprung up. Because of the large number of political prisoners in Gulag, almost every camp boasted an enviable selection of highly-skilled and trained engineers, scientists, intellectuals, and artists, and advanced lectures were delivered for the enjoyment of the educated classes and philistines alike. Art flourished as well, with poetry recitals and even hastily-prepared plays being performed. Hymns, penned by the Ukrainians, were performed en masse. One hymn in particular, with its simultaneously mournful and celebratory tone and its stirring demand for freedom, stands as representative of the prevailing themes in the works produced during the uprising: In addition to the renewed presence of religious regalia, religious practices were also given new life. Notably, one of the religious sects massed at the original hole broken into the dividing wall on the first night of the uprising, claiming that their prophet had predicted its destruction and the freedom that followed. They, according to former prisoners, then sat on mattresses for several days by the hole, praying and waiting to be taken to heaven. -LSB-edit-RSB- Government Soon after the camp was taken over, the prisoners congregated into the mess hall and decided to elect a new leader, and a former Red Army Colonel, Kapiton Kuznetsov, was chosen. A major reason for this choice was that the Ukrainian Center insisted on having Russian leadership of the rebellion and, indeed, on having the entire government be as multiethnic and multinational as possible. This was done mainly to avoid the appearance of the rebellion being anti-Russian in character, but also as an enlightened attempt to create a harmonious camp society and government. Kuznetsov and his administration were originally delegated to conduct negotiations with the camp authorities on behalf of the prisoners, but as the prisoners' control of the camp lasted beyond expectation and as demand for law, order, and efficiency increased, the jurisdiction of this government increased in turn. Therefore, various government departments were quickly created:  -LSB-edit-RSB- Propaganda The first expansion of the government's authority came as a natural extension of its role as mouthpiece of the prisoners: propaganda. A theme was carefully set by Kuznetsov and taken over by his Lithuanian deputy, Knopkus. The theme crucially undercut the main argument that would have been used by the camp authorities to crush the rebellion, which was that the rebellion was anti-Soviet in nature. Even with Stalin dead, this represented a red-line that was not to be crossed. Instead, Knopkus schemed to portray the guards as ``Beria-ites'' -LRB-a deadly charge at the time-RRB- and the rebellion as a patriotic, vanguard movement against them. Soon placards were raised declaring such sentiments as ``Long live the Soviet constitution!'' and ``Down with murdering Beria-ites!'' As the new state of affairs continued, the Propaganda department's activities grew. At first they were all largely defensive in intent -- literally just responding to allegations hurled at them across the fence. The guards broadcast propaganda over loudspeakers into the camp, urging surrender and decrying the loss of days of valuable prison labor and the alleged detrimental effect it was having on the Soviet economy. In response, the prisoners, using a modified loudspeaker, broadcast back a whole set of mock radio programmes, complete with comedy programs and skits, written by the Agitation and Propaganda department and announced by a charismatic female prisoner. One of the guard's stenographers recorded some of the broadcasts, and these records made their way into the Soviet archives. An excerpt of one broadcast: Later, with the help of the Technical Department, their schemes became increasingly ambitious. The prisoners, realizing the precariousness of their situation, endeavored to publicize their rebellion and demands to the village adjacent to the camp, hoping to incite its citizens to supportive action. To do this, they first employed specially rigged, hot air balloons with slogans written on them -LRB-these were shot down by the guards-RRB- and, later, kites manufactured by the Chechens, who turned out to be specialists in the field. The kites were successful for a time. In favorable winds, they dropped packets of leaflets to the settlements below, but the authorities soon sent up their own kites to tangle the prisoner's kite's lines. At last, seizing on a solid, successful strategy, the prisoners fixed leaflets to carrier pigeons, releasing dozens into the blue. -LSB-edit-RSB- Defense Along with propaganda, defense came to the fore of the new government's list of priorities. Before the exiled camp authorities cut off the camp's electricity, the smiths and lathe-operators in the camp fashioned all manner of weaponry in the service yard's workshops -- long pikes from prison bars, sabers, staves, and clubs amongst them. In addition to this, the prisoners ground glass into dust and placed buckets of this dust throughout the camp, hoping to blind oncoming troops with it. Barricades were established at key points, and responsibility for manning them was divided up amongst the camp barracks -LRB-renamed ``detachments'' by the Defense department-RRB-, with set shifts and procedures. The Technical Department contributed to this effort as well, namely by creating improvised explosive devices and incendiary bombs, both of which, according to Solzhenitsyn, saw use during the actual invasion in June, the latter bringing down a guard tower. -LSB-edit-RSB- Technical Department In addition to the above mentioned innovations, the Technical Department dealt with any number of problems that arose. When the exiled camp authorities cut off the camp's electrical supply, the electricians among the prisoners siphoned electricity from the wires passing overhead just outside the perimeter fence. This too was terminated by the authorities after a few days, and thereafter the prisoners used a modified motor as a generator and even improvised a running tap ``hydroelectric station'' to supply power to the government headquarters and medical barracks. -LSB-edit-RSB- Negotiations Negotiations between the authorities and rebels began almost immediately, as was becoming the custom with prisoner disturbances, but were from the beginning wrought with difficulty. The camp authorities again immediately acquiesced to virtually all of the prisoners demands, but this time, with the past deceit still fresh in their minds, the prisoners did not accept this solution as sufficient and demanded a written agreement. A draft was written up by the authorities, passed around the camp and widely panned. From here negotiations cooled until higher ranking officers came in from other cities. Solzhenitsyn explained: To these generals and others were presented the same set of demands: punishment of the soldiers responsible for the murder of various prisoners and beating of women prisoners; that prisoners who had been transferred to other camps as punishment for participating in a strike be brought back; that prisoners no longer had to wear degrading number patches or be locked into their dormitories at night; that the walls separating camp divisions -LRB-namely between the men's and women's camps-RRB- not be rebuilt; that an eight-hour work day be instituted; that limits be taken off the number of letters they could send and receive; that certain hated camp guards and officials be removed from Kengir; and that, most importantly, their cases be reviewed. None of these demands were unconstitutional. The original regulation specifically provided for all that the prisoners were asking, and that a simple reinstatement of those rights was all that was being requested. The generals, now with Sergei Yegorov, deputy chief of the MVD, and Ivan Dolgikh, division commander of Gulag, among them, once again agreed to the prisoners demands as whole, but, still failing to match a written contract to their words, they were once again rejected by the prisoners. The discussions then further broke down into threats and counter-threats. The prisoners, out of a lack of trust in their current negotiating partners, demanded that a member of the Central Committee be sent and this was flatly refused. -LSB-edit-RSB- Sowing discord Prior to the raid, attempts were made by the camp authorities to sow civil violence within the camp, both so that the prisoners would slaughter each other and make the job easier for the invading troops, and to provide an ostensible justification for the massive armed intervention to begin with. Direct requests were made to high ranking prisoners that they ``provoke racial bloodbath'' and, in exchange, get to keep their lives -LRB-any prisoner that publicly occupied a high post in the camp's provisional government was sure to be tried and executed when captured, as the prisoners themselves knew-RRB-. Banking on the still-running current of paranoia and distrust of Jews in Russia, the authorities even attempted to spread rumours in the camp that a pogrom was imminent as a way of dividing prisoners against each other. While these efforts largely failed, another objective of the authorities -- to draw out orthodox Communists and Soviet loyalists -- was successful and a number of them fled the camp in the days before the raid, including a high ranking member of the prisoner's government who would later reappear as a voice urging surrender on the guards' propaganda loudspeakers. Nevertheless, this outflow was shortly halted by Internal Security, which captured those speaking favorably of the authorities or of surrender and locked them in the camp's jail. -LSB-edit-RSB- Suppression -LSB-edit-RSB- Prelude In the days prior to the raid, small, token incursions were made. First, this was done to test the preparedness and defensive capabilities of the prisoners -- alarms were sounded and prisoners quickly assumed battle positions -- but later it was done for the sake of running film cameras. This footage later became important to the authorities in their effort to identify and punish all those who participated directly in the uprising, as well as secure their justification for the raid. At this time, the morale of the prisoners was also dropping. Many came to have a dawning sense of the futility of their own struggle, and this attitude proved infectious. The leader of the prisoners, Kuznetsov, even betrayed his wariness in a speech, retold by Solzhenitsyn: Making matters worse for the prisoners, the day before the raid it was announced on the guards' loudspeakers that their demand to meet with a member of the Central Committee was to be granted. This had the effect of lowering the prisoners guard and creating a less hostile and more favourable disposition towards the camp authorities, who were planning to violently crush the prisoners all the while. In addition, Solzhenitsyn recalls that the prisoners heard for days before the raid what they thought were the sounds of tractors running on the distance, out of sight. These turned out to be tanks, a weapon the prisoners did not anticipate being used against them. -LSB-edit-RSB- The raid In the dawn of 25 June, flares were shot up into the sky and the raid began. Snipers quickly picked off the sentries on the rooftops before they could sound the alarm, and the tanks rolled through the perimeter fence. Five tanks, 90 dogs, and 1,700 troops in full battle-gear stormed the camp complex. What followed was panic and chaos. While some `detachments' vigorously fought back, launching numerous counter-attacks despite heavy losses and throwing improvised sulfur bombs at the tanks, other prisoners hid or committed suicide. The tanks, T-34s, alternately ran over prisoners or brought down barrack walls where prisoners were hiding, and used blank rounds of ammunition to strike terror and confusion into the prisoners. The hundreds of helmeted Red Army soldiers that flooded the camp were using live ammunition, though, and with these many prisoners were killed. Some tanks carried in barbed wire-laden trestles, and these were immediately set down as a means of quickly dividing up the camp and hindering the prisoners' freedom of movement. The leaders of the uprising were specifically targeted by designated squads of soldiers and they were taken into custody alive, many of whom were later tried and executed. After ninety minutes of violence, the remaining live prisoners, most of whom were in hiding, were ordered to come out on the promise that they wouldn't be shot, which was, to everyone's surprise, a promise kept. -LSB-edit-RSB- Aftermath According to a number of survivors of the camp, five to seven hundred prisoners were either killed or wounded in the uprising, with an additional six of the highest ranking prisoners later being executed, Knopkus among them. Figures found in the Soviet archives, though, suggest that only 37 were killed, not including those who later died of their wounds or were executed, and with 106 prisoners and 40 soldiers wounded. Kuznetsov, however, had his death sentence commuted to 25 years and found himself released and fully rehabilitated after 5 years of imprisonment. Theories abound as to why, but most attribute this to the full, detailed 43-page confession he wrote in which he denounced scores of fellow prisoners. This confession also proved to be an invaluable source for many of the studies conducted on the Kengir uprising, although some question its veracity. In keeping with the prevailing theme of their story, the camp administration is said to have planted weapons on the corpses of those who didn't already have them for the sake of the photographers, who were brought in expressly for this purpose. On the day following the raid, almost a thousand prisoners were shipped off to different camps and the remaining prisoners were occupied with the task of, once again, rebuilding the destroyed wall, sealing themselves back into a life of imprisonment. -LSB-edit-RSB- Significance Among the strikes and rebellions that were taking place in Gulags across the Soviet Union in this period, the uprising at Kengir was perhaps the most significant. While Stalin's death, Beria's fall, and Khrushchev's rise bore much promise for the prisoners, who had long expected general amnesties and rehabilitation to follow these events, the role of the Kengir uprising in hastening this process cannot be overlooked. The uprising further demonstrated to the authorities that Stalinism was not a sustainable policy option and that mass injustices such as those taking place in Gulag would not stand in perpetuity without significant cost. In a shift that foreboded poorly for the Soviet regime, many of the prisoners took part knowing full well that they were doing so at the cost of their lives, and prisoners in other camps, namely in the nearby Rudnik camp, had joined with the Kengir prisoners in solidarity, launching their own short-lived strikes. The significance of the temporary freedom enjoyed by those prisoners was not lost on many. In a 1978 review of Solzhenitsyn's book, Hilton Kramer of The New York Times declared that the uprising ``restored a measure of humane civilization to the prisoners before the state was able to assert its implacable power again.'' At a 2004 reunion of Kengir prisoners, a survivor of the camp mentioned that, despite the brutality and loss of life that came with the uprising's suppression, the 40 days engendered the prisoners with ``a great feeling of freeing one's spirit'', and another prisoner recalled that ``I had not before then, and have not since, felt such a sense of freedom as I did then'' -- both sentiments echoed often by Solzhenitsyn. Indeed, Solzhenitsyn would later dedicate a screenplay he had written to the bravery of the Kengir rebels, entitled Tanks Know the Truth -LRB-Знают истину танки-RRB-. Most remarkably, as George Mason University historian Steven A. Barnes noted in a 2005 edition of Slavic Review, the prisoners' campaign was belied with a certain pragmatism, and their propaganda with a level of skill, that was all but unprecedented. As noted, instead of making explicit their hostility to the Soviet regime and handing an excuse to the authorities to invade, they ostensibly expressed approval of the state while, meekly, asking for the restoration of the rights and privileges afforded to them in the Soviet constitution. This message was itself spread not only to the camp authorities and any of the MVD-brass that would visit the camp for negotiations, but, crucially, to the civilian population surrounding the camp. Before the authorities came up with the idea of using their own rival kites to tangle and bring down the prisoner's kites with, they kept a large retinue of guards and warders, on horseback and motorcycle, waiting for the leaflets to be dropped from the kites so that they could, literally, chase down and retrieve them before they could be read by members of the public. The tact, cohesion, and ingenuity displayed in the uprising was a troubling sign to the authorities of what was perhaps to come. Nevertheless, any potential effect the uprising could have had was strictly circumscribed by the nature of the Soviet regime, which was quick to use massive force to quell even the most humble of threats. In the same Times review, Kramer issued an important caveat to his previous claim: The camp authorities again immediately acquiesced to virtually all of the prisoners demands, but this time, with the past deceit still fresh in their minds, the prisoners did not accept this solution as sufficient and demanded a written agreement. -LSB-edit-RSB- Significance Among the strikes and rebellions that were taking place in Gulags across the Soviet Union in this period, the uprising at Kengir was perhaps the most significant.

At a 2004 reunion of Kengir prisoners, a survivor of the camp mentioned that, despite the brutality and loss of life that came with the uprising's suppression, the 40 days engendered the prisoners with ``a great feeling of freeing one's spirit'', and another prisoner recalled that ``I had not before then, and have not since, felt such a sense of freedom as I did then'' -- both sentiments echoed often by Solzhenitsyn.

Adults reached 8 or 9�meters -LRB-26 to 30�ft-RRB- from snout to tail. Paleontologists have estimated full-grown adults to weigh more than 2.4�tonnes -LRB-2.7�short tons-RRB-. The largest known skull measures 99�centimeters -LRB-39�in-RRB- long, just slightly smaller than that of Daspletosaurus. As in other tyrannosaurids, the skull was large compared to its body size, although chambers within the skull bones and large openings -LRB-fenestrae-RRB- between bones reduced its weight. Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus share proportionally longer and lower skulls than Daspletosaurus and other tyrannosaurids. The end of the snout was blunt, and the nasal and parietal bones were fused along the midline of the skull, as in all other members of the family. The eye socket was circular rather than oval or keyhole-shaped as in other tyrannosaurid genera. A tall crest rose from the lacrimal bone in front of each eye, similar to Albertosaurus and Daspletosaurus. Differences in the shape of bones surrounding the brain set Gorgosaurus apart from Albertosaurus. Gorgosaurus teeth were typical of all known tyrannosaurids. The eight premaxillary teeth at the front of the snout were smaller than the rest, closely packed and D-shaped in cross section. In Gorgosaurus, the first tooth in the maxilla was also shaped like the premaxillary teeth. The rest of the teeth were oval in cross section, rather than blade-like as in most other theropods. Along with the eight premaxillary teeth, Gorgosaurus had 26 to 30�maxillary teeth and 30 to 34�teeth in the dentary bones of the lower jaw. This number of teeth is similar to Albertosaurus and Daspletosaurus but is fewer than those of Tarbosaurus or Tyrannosaurus. Gorgosaurus shared its general body plan with all other tyrannosaurids. Its massive head was perched on the end of an S-shaped neck. In contrast to its large head, its forelimbs were very small. The forelimbs had only two digits, although a third metacarpal is known in some specimens, the vestigial remains of the third digit seen in other theropods. Gorgosaurus had four digits on each hindlimb, including a small first toe -LRB-hallux-RRB- which did not contact the ground. Tyrannosaurid hindlimbs were long relative to overall body size compared with other theropods. The largest known Gorgosaurus femur measured 105�centimeters -LRB-41�in-RRB- long. In several smaller specimens of Gorgosaurus, the tibia was longer than the femur, a proportion typical of fast-running animals. The two bones were of equal length in the largest specimens. The long, heavy tail served as a counterweight to the head and torso and placed the center of gravity over the hips. -LSB-edit-RSB- Classification and systematics Gorgosaurus is classified in the theropod subfamily Albertosaurinae within the family Tyrannosauridae. It is most closely related to the slightly younger Albertosaurus. These are the only two definite albertosaurine genera that have been described, although other undescribed species may exist. Appalachiosaurus was described as a basal tyrannosauroid just outside Tyrannosauridae, although American paleontologist Thomas Holtz published a phylogenetic analysis in 2004 which indicated it was an albertosaurine. More recent, unpublished work by Holtz agrees with the original assessment. All other tyrannosaurid genera, including Daspletosaurus, Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, are classified in the subfamily Tyrannosaurinae. Compared to the tyrannosaurines, albertosaurines had slender builds, with proportionately smaller, lower skulls and longer bones of the lower leg -LRB-tibia-RRB- and feet -LRB-metatarsals and phalanges-RRB-. The close similarities between Gorgosaurus libratus and Albertosaurus sarcophagus have led many experts to combine them into one genus over the years. Albertosaurus was named first, so by convention it is given priority over the name Gorgosaurus, which is sometimes considered its junior synonym. William Diller Matthew and Barnum Brown doubted the distinction of the two genera as early as 1922. Gorgosaurus libratus was formally reassigned to Albertosaurus -LRB-as Albertosaurus libratus-RRB- by Dale Russell in 1970, and many subsequent authors followed his lead. Combining the two greatly expands the geographical and chronological range of the genus Albertosaurus. Other experts maintain the two genera as separate. Canadian paleontologist Phil Currie claims there are as many anatomical differences between Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus as there are between Daspletosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, which are almost always kept separate. He also notes that undescribed tyrannosaurids discovered in Alaska, New Mexico and elsewhere in North America may help clarify the situation. -LSB-edit-RSB- Discovery and naming Gorgosaurus libratus was first described by Lawrence Lambe in 1914. Its name is derived from the Greek γοργος/gorgos -LRB-``fierce'' or ``terrible''-RRB- and σαυρος/saurus -LRB-``lizard''-RRB-. The type species is G. libratus; the specific epithet ``balanced'' is the past participle of the Latin verb librare, meaning ``to balance''. The holotype of Gorgosaurus libratus -LRB-NMC 2120-RRB- is a nearly complete skeleton associated with a skull, discovered in 1913 by Charles M. Sternberg. This specimen was the first tyrannosaurid found with a complete hand. It was found in the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta and is housed in the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa. Prospectors from the American Museum of Natural History in New York City were active along the Red Deer River in Alberta at the same time, collecting hundreds of spectacular dinosaur specimens, including four complete G. libratus skulls, three of which were associated with skeletons. Matthew and Brown described four of these specimens in 1923. Matthew and Brown also described a fifth skeleton -LRB-AMNH 5664-RRB-, which Charles H. Sternberg had collected in 1917 and sold to their museum. It was smaller than other Gorgosaurus specimens, with a lower, lighter skull and more elongate limb proportions. Many sutures between bones were unfused in this specimen as well. Matthew and Brown noted that these features were characteristic of juvenile tyrannosaurids, but still described it as the holotype of a new species, G. sternbergi. Today's paleontologists regard this specimen as a juvenile G. libratus. Dozens of other specimens have been excavated from the Dinosaur Park Formation and are housed in museums across the United States and Canada. G. libratus is the best-represented tyrannosaurid in the fossil record, known from a virtually complete growth series. In 1856, Joseph Leidy described two tyrannosaurid premaxillary teeth from Montana. Although there was no indication of what the animal looked like, the teeth were large and robust, and Leidy gave them the name Deinodon. Matthew and Brown commented in 1922 that these teeth were indistinguishable from those of Gorgosaurus, but in the absence of skeletal remains of Deinodon, opted not to synonymize the two genera. Although Deinodon teeth are very similar to those of Gorgosaurus, tyrannosaurid teeth are extremely uniform, so it cannot be said for certain which animal they belonged to. Deinodon is regarded as a nomen dubium today. Several tyrannosaurid skeletons from the Judith River Formation of Montana probably belong to Gorgosaurus, although it remains uncertain whether they belong to G. libratus or a new species. One specimen from Montana -LRB-TCMI 2001.89.1-RRB-, housed in the Children's Museum of Indianapolis, shows evidence of severe pathologies, including healed leg, rib, and vertebral fractures, osteomyelitis -LRB-infection-RRB- at the tip of the lower jaw resulting in permanent tooth loss, and possibly a brain tumor. -LSB-edit-RSB- Misassigned species Several species were incorrectly assigned to Gorgosaurus in the twentieth century. A complete skull of a small tyrannosaurid -LRB-CMNH 7541-RRB-, found in the younger, late Maastrichtian-age Hell Creek Formation of Montana, was named Gorgosaurus lancensis by Charles Whitney Gilmore in 1946. This specimen was renamed Nanotyrannus by Bob Bakker and colleagues in 1988. Today, most paleontologists recognize Nanotyrannus as a juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex. Similarly, Evgeny Maleev created the names Gorgosaurus lancinator and Gorgosaurus novojilovi for two small tyrannosaurid specimens -LRB-PIN 553-1 and PIN 552-2-RRB- from the Nemegt Formation of Mongolia in 1955. Ken Carpenter renamed the smaller specimen Maleevosaurus novojilovi in 1992, but both are now considered juveniles of Tarbosaurus bataar. -LSB-edit-RSB- Paleobiology -LSB-edit-RSB- Coexistence with Daspletosaurus In the Dinosaur Park Formation, Gorgosaurus lived alongside a rarer species of the tyrannosaurine Daspletosaurus. This is one of the few examples of two tyrannosaur genera coexisting. Similar-sized predators in modern predator guilds are separated into different ecological niches by anatomical, behavioral or geographical differences that limit competition. Niche differentiation between the Dinosaur Park tyrannosaurids is not well-understood. In 1970, Dale Russell hypothesized the more common Gorgosaurus actively hunted fleet-footed hadrosaurs, while the rarer and more troublesome ceratopsians and ankylosaurians -LRB-horned and heavily armoured dinosaurs-RRB- were left to the more heavy-built Daspletosaurus. However, a specimen of Daspletosaurus -LRB-OTM 200-RRB- from the contemporaneous Two Medicine Formation of Montana preserves the digested remains of a juvenile hadrosaur in its gut region. Unlike some other groups of dinosaurs, neither genus was more common at higher or lower elevations than the other. However, Gorgosaurus appears more common in northern formations like the Dinosaur Park, with species of Daspletosaurus more abundant to the south. The same pattern is seen in other groups of dinosaurs. Chasmosaurine ceratopsians and hadrosaurine hadrosaurs are also more common in the Two Medicine Formation of Montana and in southwestern North America during the Campanian, while centrosaurine and lambeosaurines dominate in northern latitudes. Holtz has suggested this pattern indicates shared ecological preferences between tyrannosaurines, chasmosaurines and hadrosaurines. At the end of the later Maastrichtian stage, tyrannosaurines like Tyrannosaurus rex, hadrosaurines like Edmontosaurus and chasmosaurines like Triceratops were widespread throughout western North America, while albertosaurines and centrosaurines went extinct, and lambeosaurines were rare. -LSB-edit-RSB- Life history Gregory Erickson and colleagues have studied the growth and life history of tyrannosaurids using bone histology, which can determine the age of a specimen when it died. A growth curve can be developed when the ages of various individuals are plotted against their sizes on a graph. Tyrannosaurids grew throughout their lives, but underwent tremendous growth spurts for about four years, after an extended juvenile phase. Sexual maturity may have ended this rapid growth phase, after which growth slowed down considerably in adult animals. Examining five Gorgosaurus specimens of various sizes, Erickson calculated a maximum growth rate of about 110�kilograms -LRB-50�lb-RRB- during the rapid growth phase, slower than in tyrannosaurines like Daspletosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, but comparable to Albertosaurus. Gorgosaurus spent as much as half its life in the juvenile phase before ballooning up to near-maximum size in only a few years. This, along with the complete lack of predators intermediate in size between huge adult tyrannosaurids and other small theropods, suggests these niches may have been filled by juvenile tyrannosaurids. This is seen in modern Komodo dragons, where hatchlings start off as tree-dwelling insectivores and slowly mature into massive apex predators capable of taking down large vertebrates. Other tyrannosaurids, including Albertosaurus, have been found in aggregations that some have suggested to represent mixed-age packs, but there is no evidence of gregarious behavior in Gorgosaurus. -LSB-edit-RSB- Paleoecology All known specimens of Gorgosaurus libratus have been recovered from the Dinosaur Park Formation in Alberta. This formation dates to the middle of the Campanian, between 76.5 and 74�million years ago. At this time, the area was a coastal plain along the western edge of the Western Interior Seaway, which divided North America in half. The Laramide Orogeny had begun uplifting the Rocky Mountains to the west, from which flowed great rivers that deposited eroded sediment in vast floodplains along the coast. The climate was subtropical with marked seasonality, and periodic droughts sometimes resulted in massive mortality among the great herds of dinosaurs, as represented in the numerous bonebed deposits preserved in the Dinosaur Park Formation. Conifers formed the forest canopy, while the understory plants consisted of ferns, tree ferns and angiosperms. Around 73�million years ago, the seaway began to expand, transgressing into areas formerly above sea level and drowning the Dinosaur Park ecosystem. This transgression, called the Bearpaw Sea, is recorded by the marine sediments of the massive Bearpaw Shale. The Dinosaur Park Formation preserves a great wealth of vertebrate fossils. A wide variety of fish swam the rivers and estuaries, including gars, sturgeons, sharks and rays, among others. Frogs, salamanders, turtles, crocodilians and champsosaurs also dwelled in the aquatic habitats. Azhdarchid pterosaurs and neornithine birds like Apatornis flew overhead, while the enantiornithine bird Avisaurus lived on the ground alongside multituberculate, marsupial and placental mammals. A number of species of terrestrial lizards were also present, including whiptails, skinks, monitors and alligator lizards. Dinosaur fossils in particular are found with unrivaled abundance and diversity. Huge herds of ceratopsids roamed the floodplains alongside equally large groups of hadrosaurine and lambeosaurine hadrosaurs. Other herbivorous groups like ornithomimids, therizinosaurs, pachycephalosaurs, small ornithopods, nodosaurids and ankylosaurids were also represented. Small predatory dinosaurs like oviraptorosaurs, troodonts and dromaeosaurs hunted smaller prey than the huge tyrannosaurids, Daspletosaurus and Gorgosaurus, which were two orders of magnitude larger in mass. Intervening predatory niches may have been filled by young tyrannosaurids. Niche differentiation between the Dinosaur Park tyrannosaurids is not well-understood. This formation dates to the middle of the Campanian, between 76.5 and 74�million years ago. -LSB-edit-RSB- Paleobiology -LSB-edit-RSB- Coexistence with Daspletosaurus In the Dinosaur Park Formation, Gorgosaurus lived alongside a rarer species of the tyrannosaurine Daspletosaurus.

Australia was once part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, which also included South America, Africa, India and Antarctica. Gondwana began to break up 140�million years ago -LRB-MYA-RRB-; 50 MYA Australia separated from Antarctica and was relatively isolated until the collision of the Indo-Australian Plate with Asia in the Miocene era 5.3 MYA. The establishment and evolution of the present-day fauna was apparently shaped by the unique climate and the geology of the continent. As Australia drifted, it was, to some extent, isolated from the effects of global climate change. The unique fauna that originated in Gondwana, such as the marsupials, survived and adapted in Australia. After the Miocene, fauna of Asian origin were able to establish themselves in Australia. The Wallace Line--the hypothetical line separating the zoogeographical regions of Asia and Australasia--marks the tectonic boundary between the Eurasian and Indo-Australian plates. This continental boundary prevented the formation of land bridges and resulted in a distinct zoological distribution, with limited overlap, of most Asian and Australian fauna, with the exception of birds. Following the emergence of the circumpolar current in the mid-Oligocene era -LRB-some 15 MYA-RRB-, the Australian climate became increasingly arid, giving rise to a diverse group of arid-specialised organisms, just as the wet tropical and seasonally wet areas gave rise to their own uniquely adapted species. -LSB-edit-RSB- Mammals Australia has a rich mammalian fossil history, as well as a variety of extant mammalian species, dominated by the marsupials. The fossil record shows that monotremes have been present in Australia since the Early Cretaceous 145--99 MYA, and that marsupials and placental mammals date from the Eocene 56--34 MYA, when modern mammals first appeared in the fossil record. Although marsupials and placental mammals did coexist in Australia in the Eocene, only marsupials have survived to the present. The placental mammals made their reappearance in Australia in the Miocene, when Australia moved closer to Indonesia, and bats and rodents started to appear reliably in the fossil record. -LSB-citation needed-RSB- The marsupials evolved to fill specific ecological niches, and in many cases they are physically similar to the placental mammals in Eurasia and North America that occupy similar niches, a phenomenon known as convergent evolution. For example, the top predator in Australia, the Tasmanian Tiger, bore a striking resemblance to canids such as the Gray Wolf;-LSB-citation needed-RSB- gliding possums and flying squirrels have similar adaptations enabling their arboreal lifestyle;-LSB-citation needed-RSB- and the Numbat and anteaters are both digging insectivores. -LSB-edit-RSB- Birds Australia and its territories are home to around 800 species of bird; about 350 of these are endemic to the zoogeographic region that covers Australia, New Guinea and New Zealand. -LSB-citation needed-RSB- The fossil record of birds in Australia is patchy; however, there are records of the ancestors of contemporary species as early as the Late Oligocene. Birds with a Gondwanan history include the flightless ratites -LRB-the Emu and Southern Cassowary-RRB-, megapodes -LRB-the Malleefowl and Australian Brush-turkey-RRB-, and a huge group of endemic parrots, order Psittaciformes. Australian parrots comprise a sixth of the world's parrots, including many cockatoos and galahs. The Kookaburra is the largest species of the kingfisher family, known for its call, which sounds uncannily like loud, echoing human laughter. The passerines of Australia, also known as songbirds or perching birds, include wrens, robins, the magpie group, thornbills, pardalotes, the huge honeyeater family, treecreepers, lyrebirds, Birds of Paradise and bowerbirds. The Satin Bowerbird has attracted the interest of evolutionary psychologists; it has a complex courtship ritual in which the male creates a bower filled with blue, shiny items to woo mates. Relatively recent colonists from Eurasia are swallows,-LSB-citation needed-RSB- larks, thrushes, cisticolas, sunbirds, and some raptors, including the large Wedge-tailed Eagle. -LSB-citation needed-RSB- A number of bird species have been introduced by humans; some, like the European Goldfinch and Greenfinch, coexist happily with Australian species,-LSB-citation needed-RSB- while others, such as the Common Starling, Common Blackbird, House Sparrow and Indian Mynah, are destructive of some native bird species and thus destabilise the native ecosystem. About 200 species of seabird live on the Australian coast, including many species of migratory seabird. Australia is at the southern end of the East Asian-Australasian flyway for migratory water birds, which extends from Far-East Russia and Alaska through Southeast Asia to Australia and New Zealand. About two million birds travel this route to and from Australia each year. -LSB-citation needed-RSB- One very common large seabird is the Australian Pelican, which can be found in most waterways in Australia. The Little Penguin is the only species of penguin that breeds on mainland Australia. -LSB-edit-RSB- Amphibians and reptiles Australia has four families of native frogs and one introduced toad, the Cane Toad. In 1935 the Cane Toad was introduced to Australia in a failed attempt to control pests in sugarcane crops. It has since become a devastating pest, spreading across northern Australia. As well as competing with native insectivores for food, the Cane Toad produces a venom that is toxic to native fauna, as well as to humans. The Myobatrachidae, or southern frogs, are Australia's largest group of frogs, with 120 species from 21 genera. -LSB-citation needed-RSB- A notable member of this group is the colourful and endangered Corroboree Frog. The tree frogs, from family Hylidae, are common in high rainfall areas on the north and east coasts; there are 77 Australian species from three genera. -LSB-citation needed-RSB- The 18 species from two genera-LSB-citation needed-RSB- of the Microhylidae frogs are restricted to the rainforests; the smallest species, the Scanty Frog, is from this family. -LSB-citation needed-RSB- There is a single species from the world's dominant frog group, family Ranidae -- the Australian Wood Frog -- which only occurs in the Queensland rainforests. As elsewhere, there has been a precipitous decline in Australia's frog populations in recent years. Although the full reasons for the decline are uncertain, it can be at least partly attributed to the fatal amphibian fungal disease chytridiomycosis. Australia has both saltwater and freshwater crocodiles. The Saltwater Crocodile, known colloquially as the ``salty,'' is the largest living crocodile species; reaching over 7�m, and weighing over 1,000�kg, they can and do kill people. They live on the coast and in the freshwater rivers and wetlands of northern Australia, and they are farmed for their meat and leather. Freshwater Crocodiles, found only in northern Australia, are not considered dangerous to humans. The Australian coast is visited by six species of sea turtle: the Flatback, Green Sea, Hawksbill, Olive Ridley, Loggerhead and the Leatherback Sea Turtles; all are protected in Australian waters. There are 29 species of Australian freshwater turtles from eight genera of family Chelidae. -LSB-citation needed-RSB- The Pig-nosed Turtle is the only Australian turtle not of that family. Australia and Antarctica are the only continents without any living species of land tortoise. -LSB-citation needed-RSB- Australia is the only continent-LSB-citation needed-RSB- where venomous snakes outnumber their non-venomous cousins. Australian snakes belong to seven families. Of these, the most venomous species,-LSB-citation needed-RSB- including the Fierce Snake, Eastern Brown Snake, Taipan and Eastern Tiger Snake are from the family Elapidae. Of the 200 species of elapid, 86 are found only in Australia. -LSB-citation needed-RSB- Thirty-three sea snakes from family Hydrophiidae inhabit Australia's northern waters; many are extremely venomous. Two species of sea snake from the Acrochordidae also occur in Australian waters. Australia has only 11 species from the world's most significant snake family Colubridae; none are endemic, and they are considered to be relatively recent arrivals from Asia. There are 15 python species and 31 species of insectivorous blind snake. -LSB-citation needed-RSB- There are more lizards in Australia than anywhere else in the world,-LSB-citation needed-RSB- with representatives of five families. There are 114 species in 18 genera of gecko found throughout the Australian continent. -LSB-citation needed-RSB- The Pygopodidae is a family of limbless lizards endemic to the Australian region; of the 34 species from eight genera, only one species does not occur in Australia. -LSB-citation needed-RSB- The Agamidae or Dragon lizards are represented by 66 species in 13 genera,-LSB-citation needed-RSB- including the Thorny Devil, Bearded Dragon and Frill-necked Lizard. There are 26 species of monitor lizard,-LSB-citation needed-RSB- family Varanidae, in Australia, where they are commonly known as goannas. The largest Australian monitor is the Perentie, which can reach up to 2�m in length. There are 389 species of skink from 38 genera, comprising about 50% of the total Australian lizard fauna;-LSB-citation needed-RSB- this group includes the blue-tongued lizards. -LSB-edit-RSB- Fish More than 4,400 species of fish inhabit Australia's waterways; of these, 90% are endemic. However, because of the relative scarcity of freshwater waterways, Australia has only 170 species of freshwater fish. -LSB-citation needed-RSB- Two families of freshwater fish have ancient origins: the arowana or ``bony tongues,'' and the Queensland lungfish. The Queensland lungfish is the most primitive of the lungfish, having evolved before Australia separated from Gondwana. One of the smallest freshwater fish, peculiar to the southwest of Western Australia, is the salamanderfish, which can survive desiccation in the dry season by burrowing into mud. Other families with a potentially Gondwanan origin include the Retropinnidae, Galaxiidae, Aplochitonidae and Percichthyidae. -LSB-citation needed-RSB-Apart from the ancient freshwater species, 70% of Australia's freshwater fish have affinities with tropical Indo-Pacific marine species that have adapted to freshwater. Nevertheless, fossil evidence indicates that many of these freshwater species are still ancient in origin. -LSB-citation needed-RSB- These species include freshwater lampreys, herrings, catfish, rainbowfish, and some 50 species of gudgeon, including the Sleepy Cod. -LSB-citation needed-RSB- Native freshwater game fish include the Barramundi, Murray Cod, and Golden Perch. -LSB-citation needed-RSB- Two species of endangered freshwater shark are found in the Northern Territory. Several exotic freshwater fish species, including brown, brook and rainbow trout, Atlantic and Chinook salmon, redfin perch, carp and mosquitofish, have been introduced to Australian waterways. The mosquitofish is a particularly aggressive species known for harassing and nipping the fins of other fish. It has been linked to declines and localised extinctions of several small native fish species. The introduced trout species have had serious negative impacts on a number of upland native fish species including trout cod, Macquarie perch and galaxias species as well as other upland fauna such as the Spotted Tree Frog. The carp is strongly implicated in the dramatic loss in waterweed, decline of small native fish species and permanently elevated levels of turbidity in the Murray-Darling Basin of southwest Australia. -LSB-citation needed-RSB- Most of Australia's fish species are marine. -LSB-citation needed-RSB- Groups of interest include the moray eels and squirrelfish, as well as the pipefish and seahorses, whose males incubate their partner's eggs in a specialised pouch. There are 80 species of grouper in Australian waters,-LSB-citation needed-RSB- including one of the world's biggest bony fish, the Giant Grouper, which can grow as large as 2.7�m and weigh up to 400�kg. The trevally, a group of 50 species of silver schooling fish, and the snappers are popular species for commercial fishing. The Great Barrier Reef supports a huge variety of small- and medium-sized reef fish, including the damselfish, butterflyfish, angelfish, gobies, cardinalfish, wrassees, triggerfish and surgeonfish. There are several venomous fish, among them several species of stonefish and pufferfish and the red lionfish, all of which have toxins that can kill humans. There are 11 venomous species of stingray,-LSB-citation needed-RSB- the largest of which is the smooth stingray. The barracudas are one of the reef's largest species. However, large reef fish should not be eaten for fear of ciguatera poisoning. Sharks inhabit all the coastal waters and estuarine habitats of Australia's coast. There are 166 species, including 30 species of requiem shark, 32 of catshark, six of wobbegong shark, and 40 of dogfish shark. There are three species from the family Heterodontidae: the Port Jackson shark, the zebra bullhead shark and the crested bullhead shark. -LSB-citation needed-RSB- In 2004, there were 12 unprovoked shark attacks in Australia, of which two were fatal. Only 3 species of shark pose a significant threat to humans: the bull shark, the tiger shark and the great white shark. Some popular beaches in Queensland and New South Wales are protected by shark netting, a method that has reduced the population of both dangerous and harmless shark species through accidental entanglement. -LSB-citation needed-RSB- The overfishing of sharks has also significantly reduced shark numbers in Australian waters, and several species are now endangered. -LSB-citation needed-RSB- A megamouth shark was found on a Perth beach in 1988; very little is known about this species, but this discovery may indicate the presence of the species in Australian coastal waters. -LSB-edit-RSB- Invertebrates Of the estimated 200,000 animal species in Australia, about 96% are invertebrates. While the full extent of invertebrate diversity is uncertain, 90% of insects and molluscs are considered endemic. Invertebrates occupy many ecological niches and are important in all ecosystems as decomposers, pollinators, and food sources. The largest group of invertebrates is the insects, comprising 75% of Australia's known species of animals. The most diverse insect orders are the Coleoptera, with 28,200 species of beetles and weevils, the Lepidoptera with 20,816 species-LSB-citation needed-RSB- including butterflies and moths, and 12,781 species of Hymenoptera,-LSB-citation needed-RSB- including the ants, bees and wasps. Order Diptera, which includes the flies and mosquitoes, comprises 7,786 species,-LSB-citation needed-RSB- Order Hemiptera, including bugs, aphids and hoppers, comprises 5,650 species; and there are 2,827 species-LSB-citation needed-RSB- of order Orthoptera, including grasshoppers, crickets and katydids. Introduced species that pose a significant threat to native species include the European wasp, the red fire ant, the yellow crazy ant and feral honeybees which compete with native bees. Australia has a wide variety of arachnids, including 135 species of spider that are familiar enough to have common names. -LSB-citation needed-RSB- There are numerous highly venomous species, including the notorious Sydney funnel-web and redback spiders, whose bites can be deadly. There are thousands of species of mites and ticks from order Acarina. Australia also has eight species of pseudoscorpion and nine scorpion species. In the Annelida -LRB-sub-RRB-class Oligochaeta there are many families of aquatic worms, and for native terrestrial worms: the Enchytraeidae -LRB-pot worms-RRB- and the ``true'' earthworms in families Acanthodrilidae, Octochaetidae and Megascolecidae. -LSB-citation needed-RSB- The latter includes the world's largest earthworm, the giant Gippsland earthworm, found only in Gippsland, Victoria. On average they reach 80�cm in length, but specimens up to 3.7�m in length have been found. -LSB-citation needed-RSB- The large family Parastacidae includes 124 species of Australian freshwater crayfish. -LSB-citation needed-RSB- These include the world's smallest crayfish, the swamp crayfish, which does not exceed 30�mm in length, and the world's largest crayfish, the Tasmanian giant freshwater crayfish, measuring up to 76�cm long and weighing 4.5�kg. The crayfish genus Cherax includes the common yabby, in addition to the farmed species marron and Queensland red claw. Species from the genus Engaeus, commonly known as the land crayfish, are also found in Australia. Engaeus species are not entirely aquatic, because they spend most of their lives living in burrows. Australia has seven species of freshwater crab from the genus Austrothelphusa. These crabs live burrowed into the banks of waterways and can plug their burrows, surviving through several years of drought. The extremely primitive freshwater mountain shrimp, found only in Tasmania, are a unique group, resembling species found in the fossil record from 200 MYA. A huge variety of marine invertebrates are found in Australian waters, with the Great Barrier Reef an important source of this diversity. -LSB-citation needed-RSB- Families include the Porifera or sea sponges, the Cnidaria -LRB-includes the jellyfish, corals and sea anemones, comb jellies-RRB-, the Echinodermata -LRB-includes the sea urchins, sea stars, brittle stars, sea cucumbers, the lamp shells-RRB- and the Mollusca -LRB-includes snails, slugs, limpets, squid, octopus, cockles, oysters, clams, and chitons-RRB-. Venomous invertebrates include the box jellyfish, the blue-ringed octopus, and ten species of cone snail,-LSB-citation needed-RSB- which can cause respiratory failure and death in humans. The crown-of-thorns starfish usually inhabits the Reef at low densities. However, under conditions that are not yet well understood, they can reproduce to reach an unsustainable population density when coral is devoured at a rate faster than it can regenerate. This presents a serious reef management issue. -LSB-citation needed-RSB- Other problematic marine invertebrates include the native species purple sea-urchin and the white urchin, which have been able to take over marine habitats and form urchin barrens due to the over harvesting of their natural predators which include abalone and rock lobster. -LSB-citation needed-RSB- Introduced invertebrate pests include the Asian mussel, New Zealand green-lipped mussel, black-striped mussel and the Northern Pacific seastar, all of which displace native shellfish. -LSB-citation needed-RSB- There are many unique marine crustaceans in Australian waters. The best-known class, to which all the edible species of crustacean belong, is Malacostraca. -LSB-citation needed-RSB- The warm waters of northern Australia are home to many species of decapod crustaceans, including crabs, false crabs, hermit crabs, lobsters, shrimps, and prawns. The Peracarids, including the amphipods and isopods, are more diverse in the colder waters of southern Australia. -LSB-citation needed-RSB- Less-well-known marine groups include the classes Remipedia, Cephalocarida, Branchiopoda, Maxillopoda -LRB-which includes the barnacles, copepods and fish lice-RRB-, and the Ostracoda. Notable species include the Tasmanian giant crab, the second largest crab species in the world,-LSB-citation needed-RSB- found in deep water, and weighing up to 13�kg, and the Australian spiny lobsters, such as the Western rock lobster, which are distinct from other lobster species as they do not have claws. -LSB-edit-RSB- Invasive species Introduction of exotic fauna in Australia by design, accident and natural processes has led to a considerable number of invasive, feral and pest species which have flourished and now impact the environment adversely. Introduced organisms affect the environment in a number of ways. -LSB-citation needed-RSB- Rabbits render land economically useless by eating everything. Red Foxes affect local endemic fauna by predation while the cane toad poisons the predators by being eaten. The invasive species include birds -LRB-Indian Mynah-RRB- and fish -LRB-common carp-RRB-, insects -LRB-red imported fire ant-RRB- and molluscs -LRB-Asian mussel-RRB-. The problem is compounded by invasive exotic flora as well as introduced diseases, fungi and parasites. Costly, laborious and time-consuming efforts at control of these species has met with little success and this continues to be a major problem area in the conservation of Australia's biodiversity. -LSB-edit-RSB- Human impact and conservation For at least 40,000 years, Australia's fauna played an integral role in the traditional lifestyles of Indigenous Australians, who exploited many species as a source of food and skins. Vertebrates commonly harvested included macropods, opossums, seals, fish and the Short-tailed Shearwater, most commonly known as the Muttonbird. Invertebrates used as food included insects such as the Bogong moth and larvae collectively called witchetty grubs and molluscs. The use of fire-stick farming, in which large swathes of bushland were burnt to facilitate hunting, modified both flora and fauna -- and are thought to have contributed to the extinction of large herbivores with a specialised diet, such as the flightless birds from the genus Genyornis. The role of hunting and landscape modification by aboriginal people in the extinction of the Australian megafauna is debated. The impact of Aborigines on native species populations is widely considered to be less significant than that of the European settlers, whose impact on the landscape has been on a relatively large scale. Since European settlement, direct exploitation of native fauna, habitat destruction and the introduction of exotic predators and competitive herbivores has led to the extinction of some 27 mammal, 23 bird and 4 frog species. Much of Australia's fauna is protected by legislation;-LSB-citation needed-RSB- a notable exception is kangaroos, which are prolific and are regularly culled. The federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 was created to meet Australia's obligations as a signatory to the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity. This act protects all native fauna and provides for the identification and protection of threatened species. In each state and territory, there is statutory listing of threatened species. At present, 380 animal species are classified as either endangered or threatened under the EPBC Act, and other species are protected under state and territory legislation. More broadly, a complete cataloguing of all the species within Australia has been undertaken, a key step in the conservation of Australian fauna and biodiversity. In 1973, the federal government established the Australian Biological Resources Study -LRB-ABRS-RRB-, which coordinates research in the taxonomy, identification, classification and distribution of flora and fauna. The ABRS maintains free online databases cataloguing much of the described Australian flora and fauna. Impacts such as the illegal setting of traps in rivers affect animals such as the Australian platypus, along with lack of awareness each year an average of 2--5 Australians lose their lives to what is presumed a safe creature. The key is understanding of Australia's diverse wildlife and fauna; what seems safe is often deadly. Australia is a member of the International Whaling Commission and is strongly opposed to commercial whaling--all Cetacean species are protected in Australian waters. Australia is also a signatory to the CITES agreement and prohibits the export of endangered species. Protected areas have been created in every state and territory to protect and preserve the country's unique ecosystems. These protected areas include national parks and other reserves, as well as 64 wetlands registered under the Ramsar Convention and 16 World Heritage Sites. As of 2002, 10.8% -LRB-774,619.51�km²-RRB- of the total land area of Australia is within protected areas. Protected marine zones have been created in many areas to preserve marine biodiversity; as of 2002, these areas cover about 7% -LRB-646,000�km²-RRB- of Australia's marine jurisdiction. The Great Barrier Reef is managed by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority under specific federal and state legislation. Some of Australia's fisheries are already overexploited, and quotas have been set for the sustainable harvest of many marine species. The State of the Environment Report, 2001, prepared by independent researchers for the federal government, concluded that the condition of the environment and environmental management in Australia had worsened since the previous report in 1996. Of particular relevance to wildlife conservation, the report indicated that many processes--such as salinity, changing hydrological conditions, land clearing, fragmentation of ecosystems, poor management of the coastal environment, and invasive species--pose major problems for protecting Australia's biodiversity. As Australia drifted, it was, to some extent, isolated from the effects of global climate change. As Australia drifted, it was, to some extent, isolated from the effects of global climate change. -LSB-edit-RSB- Origins Both geologic and climatic events helped to make Australia's fauna unique.

Since European settlement, direct exploitation of native fauna, habitat destruction and the introduction of exotic predators and competitive herbivores has led to the extinction of some 27 mammal, 23 bird and 4 frog species. -LSB-citation needed-RSB- The overfishing of sharks has also significantly reduced shark numbers in Australian waters, and several species are now endangered. Australia also has eight species of pseudoscorpion and nine scorpion species. The unique fauna that originated in Gondwana, such as the marsupials, survived and adapted in Australia.

The Morrill Act, signed into law July 2, 1862, was created to enable states to establish colleges where the ``leading object shall be, without excluding other scientific and classical studies and including military tactics, to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and mechanical arts...in order to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions in life''. States were granted public lands to be sold at auctions to establish a permanent fund to support the schools. Both the Republic of Texas and the Texas State Legislature also set aside public lands for a future college. The Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, known as Texas A.M.C., was established by the state legislature on April 17, 1871 as the state's first public institution of higher education. The legislature provided US$75,000 for the construction of buildings at the new school, and state leaders invested profits from the sale of 180,000�acres -LRB-730�km2-RRB- received under the Land-Grant College Act in gold frontier defense bonds, creating a permanent endowment for the college. A committee tasked with finding a home for the new college chose Brazos County, which agreed to donate 2,416�acres -LRB-10�km2-RRB- of land. Jefferson Davis, former President of the Confederate States of America, was offered the presidency of the college but turned it down. The college officially opened on October 4, 1876 with six professors. Forty�students were present on the first day of classes, but by the end of the school year the number had grown to 106�students. Only men were admitted, and all students were required to participate in the Corps of Cadets and receive military training. The campus bore minimal resemblance to its modern counterpart. Wild animals roamed freely around the campus, and the area served as a meeting point for the Great Western Cattle Trail. Despite its name, the college taught no classes in agriculture, instead concentrating on classical studies, languages, literature, and applied mathematics. After four years, students could attain degrees in scientific agriculture, civil and mining engineering, and language and literature. Local farmers complained that the college was abusing its mission, and, in November 1879, the president and faculty were replaced and given a mandated curriculum in agriculture and engineering. During these early years, student life was molded by the Corps of Cadets. The Corps was divided into a battalion of three companies, and rivalry among the companies was strong, giving birth to the Aggie spirit and future traditions. No bonfires, yell practices, or athletics teams existed as yet, and social clubs and fraternities were discouraged. Enrollment, which had climbed as high as 500�students, declined to only 80�students in 1883, the year the University of Texas opened in Austin, Texas. Although the Texas Constitution specified that the Agricultural and Mechanical College was to be a branch of a proposed University of Texas, the Austin school was established with a separate Board of Regents. Texas A.M.C. continued to be governed by its own Board of Directors. The two Texas schools quickly began to battle over the limited funds that the state legislature made available for higher education. In 1887, the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station was established at Texas A.M.C., enabling the college to gain more funding. Many residents of the state saw little need for two colleges in Texas, and some wanted to close the agricultural and mechanical school. -LSB-edit-RSB- Sul Ross era Texas A.M.C. president Lawrence Sullivan Ross, known affectionately to students as ``Sully'', is credited for saving the school from closure and transforming it into a respected military institution. Ross, the immediate past governor of Texas, had been a well-respected Confederate Brigadier General and enjoyed a good reputation among state residents. When Ross arrived at the school, he found no running water, a housing shortage, a disgruntled faculty, and many students running wild. As Ross began to make improvements, parents began to send their children to the school in the hopes that they would learn from Ross's example. Although enrollment had always been limited to men, in 1893, Ethel Hudson, the daughter of an A&M professor, became the first woman to attend classes at the school and helped edit the annual yearbook. She was made an honorary member of the class of 1895. Several years later her twin sisters became honorary members of the class of 1903, and slowly other daughters of Aggie professors were allowed to attend classes. Under Ross's seven and one-half year tenure, many enduring Aggie traditions formed. These traditions include the first Aggie Ring, the first yearbook, and the formation of the Aggie Band. Ross's tenure also saw the school's first intercollegiate football game, played against the University of Texas. -LSB-edit-RSB- Program expansion By 1910, the school listed eight degree programs, including agriculture, architecture, agricultural engineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and textile engineering. Five years later the state legislature, in cooperation with the United States Department of Agriculture, established the Texas Agricultural Extension Service, organized the Texas Forest Service, and authorized a School of Veterinary Medicine at the college. The college was unprepared for the growth, and for the next ten years several hundred students lived in tents in a field in the middle of campus. During this time, women were also given a more official standing. The Texas Legislature in 1911 refused to give A&M permission to hold a summer semester unless women were also permitted to attend. For the next several decades during the summers cadets were not required to be in uniform and women could attend class and participate in intramural activities. Texas A&M graduates were called to use their military training during World War I, and by 1918, 49% of all graduates of the college were in military service, a larger percentage than any other college or university. In early September 1918, the entire senior class was mustered into military service, with plans to send the younger students at staggered dates throughout the next year. Many of the seniors were fighting in France when the war ended two months later. In total, over 1200 former students served as commissioned officers during World War I.  Texas A&M Hillel, the oldest Hillel organization in the United States, was founded in 1920. The organization occurred three years before the national Hillel Foundation was organized at the University of Illinois. After the war, Texas A&M grew rapidly and became nationally recognized for its programs in agriculture, engineering, and military science. The first graduate school was organized in 1924, and, in 1925, Mary Evelyn Crawford Locke became the first female to receive a diploma from Texas A&M, although she was not allowed to participate in the graduation ceremony. The following month the Board of Directors officially prohibited all women from enrolling. In 1926, they codified that women in summer school had an unofficial status and could not pursue a degree. By 1930, however, over 1800 women had attended classes at A&M. In the late 1920s, following the discovery of oil on university lands, Texas A&M and the University of Texas negotiated a settlement for the division of the Permanent University Fund which enabled A&M to receive one-third of the revenue. This guaranteed wealth enabled A&M to expand. Enrollment increased even during the Great Depression, as student cooperative housing projects enabled the students to attend the school at low costs. During the Depression, as professors were forced to accept a 25% pay cut, the Board of Directors partially rescinded its order against female enrollment, allowing no more than 20 females at a time to enroll in the school, and further restricting the group to daughters of professors. Texas A&M expanded its degree offerings in the late 1930s and awarded its first Ph.D. in 1940. Other programs at the college likewise began offering doctoral degrees throughout the next few decades. World War II gave Texas A&M an opportunity to prove itself on a worldwide stage. The school produced 20,229 fighting men who served in combat; of these, 14,123 were officers, more than the combined total of the United States Naval Academy and the United States Military Academy and more than three times the totals of any other Senior Military College. Seven Aggies received the Medal of Honor during the worldwide conflict, tying with Virginia Tech as the most of any school outside of the military academies at West Point and Annapolis, and 29 former students reached the rank of general. In addition, the college received nationwide exposure during the war when a reporter wrote a widely distributed story about the Aggie Muster on the island of Corregidor. The intense interest resulted in a World War II propaganda movie, We've Never Been Licked, which was filmed on the A&M campus and showcased many of the school traditions. Though Texas A&M was originally established as a branch of the yet-to-be-created University of Texas, subsequent acts of the Texas Legislature never gave the University any authority over Texas A&M. This internal legal conflict in Texas was nullified in 1948 when Texas A&M became the flagship school of the newly created Texas A&M University System, a clear and separate institution from the University of Texas System. A&M's Board of Directors continued to oversee the system. Enrollment soared as many former soldiers used the G.I. Bill to further their education. Unprepared for the growth, between 1949 and 1953 Texas A&M used the former Bryan Air Force Base as an extension of the campus. An estimated 5,500 men lived, studied, ate, showered, and attended classes at the base, which became known as the Annex -LRB-and later as Riverside Campus-RRB-. -LSB-edit-RSB- Rudder era The Texas Legislature defeated a nonbinding resolution in the 1950s to encourage A&M to admit women. The school newspaper, The Battalion began writing editorials to encourage coeducation, causing the Student Senate to demand the editor of the paper resign. Later in the year students defeated 2--1 a campus resolution on coeducation. On March 26, 1959 retired Major General James Earl Rudder, who arguably had the most significant effect on the campus, became the 16th president of the college, his alma mater. At the time, the college was still an all-male military school with a 7,500 student enrollment. Within several years of his arrival, the 58th Legislature of Texas officially changed the name of the school from the A&M College of Texas to Texas A&M University. The Legislature specified that in the new name of the school, the A and the M were purely symbolic, reflecting the school's past, and no longer stood for ``Agricultural and Mechanical''. With Rudder's strong encouragement, in 1963, the A&M Board of Directors officially reversed their stance on admitting women. The wives and daughters of faculty, staff and students as well as female staff members were finally allowed to officially participate in undergraduate programs, although they were not permitted to join the Corps of Cadets. The following year the college was officially integrated as A&M welcomed its first African American student. More change ensued, as, in 1965, the Board of Directors voted to make membership in the Corps of Cadets voluntary. The same year the Board voted to allow any woman, not just those connected to students and professors, to attend the university. The Board required that Rudder approve each female applicant; he accepted any woman who met the academic requirements. During Rudder's tenure, African-American students were also welcomed, and in 1967, James L. Courtney of Dallas became the first African-American to receive an undergraduate degree from Texas A&M University. He remained at Texas A&M and, in 1970, became the first African-American to receive a D.V.M. degree from the College of Veterinary Medicine. When Rudder died in 1970, after 11 years as president of the school, Texas A&M University had grown to more than 14,000 students from all 50 states and 75 nations. The school had become coeducational and had even begun construction of an all-female dormitory. The curriculum had been broadened, with upgraded academic and faculty standards, and the school had initiated a multi-million dollar building program. -LSB-edit-RSB- Recent years On September 17, 1971, Texas A&M University was one of the first four institutions to be designated a sea-grant college in recognition of oceanographic development and research. A third designation was added on August 31, 1989 when Texas A&M was named a space-grant college. The university remains one of few institutions nationwide to hold designations as a land-, sea-, and space-grant college. -LSB-edit-RSB- Diversification The Corps welcomed its first female members in the fall of 1974. At the time, the women were segregated into a special unit, known as W-1, and suffered harassment from many of their male counterparts. Women were originally prohibited from serving in leadership positions or in the more elite Corps units such as the band and Ross Volunteers. These groups were opened to female participation in 1988, following a federal court decision in a class-action lawsuit filed by a female cadet. Two years later, in 1990, female-only units were eliminated. In November 1976, the university denied official recognition to the Gay Student Services Organization on the grounds that homosexuality was illegal in Texas, and the group's stated goals--offering referral services and providing educational information to students--were actually the responsibility of university staff. The students sued the university for violation of their First Amendment right to freedom of speech in February 1977. For six years, Gay Student Services v. Texas A&M University wound its way through the courts; although the trial court ruled in favor of Texas A&M several times, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals repeatedly overturned the verdict. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to take the case, letting stand the circuit court ruling that the students' free speech rights had been compromised. The case set a national precedent by removing all legal restrictions against gay rights groups on campuses. The subsequent recognition of the group provided a university precedent for allowing social organizations. In 1977, the university had also denied recognition to Sigma Phi Epsilon, a national social fraternity, because its presence on campus might result in ``a social caste system''. -LSB-edit-RSB- Presidential library The George Bush Presidential Library was established in 1997 on 90�acres -LRB-364,220�m2-RRB- of land donated by Texas A&M at the western edge of the campus. This tenth presidential library was built between 1995 and 1997 and contains the presidential and vice-presidential papers of George H.W. Bush and the vice-presidential papers of Dan Quayle. To coincide with the opening of the George Bush Presidential Library, Texas A&M established the George Bush School of Government and Public Service. The school, offers a master's degree in public policy and one in international affairs as well as two research degrees, officially launched in 1997. It became a separate school within the university in 1999. -LSB-edit-RSB- Bonfire collapse At 2:42�a.m. on November 18, 1999, the partially completed Aggie Bonfire, standing 40�feet -LRB-12�m-RRB- tall and consisting of about 5000 logs, collapsed during construction. Of the 58 students and former students working on the stack, 12 were killed and 27 others were injured. The incident received nationwide attention, with over 50 satellite trucks broadcasting from the Texas A&M campus within hours. On November 25, 1999, the date that Bonfire would have burned, Aggies instead held a vigil and remembrance ceremony on site. Over 40,000 people, including former President George H.W. Bush and his wife Barbara and then-Texas governor George W. Bush and his wife Laura, lit candles and observed up to two hours of silence at the site of the Bonfire collapse. A commission put together by Texas A&M University discovered that a number of factors led to the Bonfire collapse, including ``excessive internal stresses'' on the logs and ``inadequate containment strength'', where the wiring used to tie the logs together was not strong enough. The wiring broke after logs from upper tiers were ``wedged'' into lower tiers. Texas A&M officials, Bonfire student leaders, and the university itself were the subject of several lawsuits by parents of the students injured or deceased in the collapse. On May 21, 2004, Federal Judge Samuel B. Kent dismissed all claims against the Texas A&M officials, and, in 2005, 36 of the 64 original defendants, including all of the student leaders, settled their portion of the case for an estimated US$4.25 million, paid by their insurance companies. A federal appeals court dismissed the remaining lawsuits against Texas A&M and its officials in 2007. -LSB-edit-RSB- Vision 2020 In 1997, university president Ray Bowen appointed a task force to create a new strategic plan for the university. The task force, made up of more than 250 faculty, staff, students, former students, local residents, and various private- and public-sector representatives, devoted more than two years to examining all aspects of the university and studying benchmark institutions before unveiling the plan, dubbed Vision 2020, in 1999. Vision 2020's goal is to make Texas A&M University recognized as a consensus ``top 10'' public university by the year 2020. The plan identifies 12 areas in which the university should focus on improving. Dr. Robert M. Gates succeeded Bowen in 2002, and during his four year tenure as president, Vision 2020's short-term focus narrowed to four key steps:  Gates' leadership resulted in the largest academic expansion in the university's history. As of September 8, 2006, Vision 2020's progress includes:  -LSB-edit-RSB- Hurricane relief Following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Texas A&M opened Reed Arena as a temporary shelter to house over 200 evacuees from New Orleans. Although school was barely in session and there was minimal notice, the students and staff of A&M prepared the facility, setting up several hundred beds on the arena floor and making arrangements for the evacuees to get new clothes and have medical checks. Aggie students organized a child care facility, and Aggie athletes escorted teenagers to the Aggie Rec Center to play basketball. Less than three weeks later, Reed Arena was again opened as a temporary shelter for people fleeing Hurricane Rita. -LSB-edit-RSB- Current status With strong support from Rice University and the University of Texas at Austin, the Association of American Universities inducted Texas A&M in May 2001, based on the depth of the university's research and academic programs. Furthermore, in 2004, the honors organization Phi Beta Kappa opened its 265th chapter at Texas A&M. On December 18, 2006, former Texas A&M University president Robert M. Gates was sworn in as the 22nd U.S. Secretary of Defense. Gates' successor, Elsa Murano, on January 3, 2008 became both the university's first female and first Hispanic president. Murano's term as president ended abruptly June 2009, and was succeeded by Interim President R. Bowen Loftin. Loftin was eventually selected as university president in February of 2010. The university has a current enrollment of more than 45,000, with more than 8,000 graduate and professional students, making it one of the largest universities in America. As of 2007, the percentage of women and men at the school are roughly equal. However, for a number of years female of the freshman class have outnumbered males. The university has awarded more than 320,000 degrees, of which 70,000 have been graduate and professional degrees. Texas A&M has two branch campuses, one in Galveston, Texas, and one in the Middle Eastern country of Qatar. This internal legal conflict in Texas was nullified in 1948 when Texas A&M became the flagship school of the newly created Texas A&M University System, a clear and separate institution from the University of Texas System. The Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, known as Texas A.M.C., was established by the state legislature on April 17, 1871 as the state's first public institution of higher education. Only men were admitted, and all students were required to participate in the Corps of Cadets and receive military training. The university remains one of few institutions nationwide to hold designations as a land-, sea-, and space-grant college. In total, over 1200 former students served as commissioned officers during World War I.  Texas A&M Hillel, the oldest Hillel organization in the United States, was founded in 1920. On March 26, 1959 retired Major General James Earl Rudder, who arguably had the most significant effect on the campus, became the 16th president of the college, his alma mater.

The survivors are informed of the plan by the Other Karl -LRB-Blake Bashoff-RRB- and conceive a plan to kill the Others with dynamite-rigged tents. Sayid Jarrah -LRB-Naveen Andrews-RRB-, Jin Kwon -LRB-Daniel Dae Kim-RRB- and Bernard Nadler -LRB-Sam Anderson-RRB- remain at the beach, tasked with shooting the dynamite-rigged tents while the rest of the survivors journey with Danielle Rousseau -LRB-Mira Furlan-RRB- to the radio tower to communicate with Naomi Dorrit's -LRB-Marsha Thomason-RRB- nearby ship. The Others arrive, and while Sayid and Bernard detonate their tents, Jin misses his target, which results in their capture by the Others: Tom -LRB-M.C. Gainey-RRB-, Ryan Pryce -LRB-Brian Goodman-RRB- and Jason -LRB-Ariston Green-RRB-, and the deaths of seven Others. After hearing only two explosions, James ``Sawyer'' Ford -LRB-Josh Holloway-RRB- and Juliet Burke -LRB-Elizabeth Mitchell-RRB- turn back to see if they can help. Hugo ``Hurley'' Reyes -LRB-Jorge Garcia-RRB-, who was not allowed to accompany Sawyer and Juliet because of his weight, drives the van he found onto the beach, and the captives gain the upper hand, killing the remaining Others with the help of Sawyer and Juliet. Tom surrenders but Sawyer shoots him in the chest anyway. After knocking Desmond Hume -LRB-Henry Ian Cusick-RRB- unconscious, Charlie Pace -LRB-Dominic Monaghan-RRB- dives down into The Looking Glass, a research station of the Dharma Initiative, with the hope of disabling the system jamming outgoing transmissions. Charlie is captured by the resident Others Greta -LRB-Lana Parrilla-RRB- and Bonnie -LRB-Tracy Middendorf-RRB-. Ben Linus -LRB-Michael Emerson-RRB- learns of Charlie's infiltration and sends Mikhail Bakunin -LRB-Andrew Divoff-RRB- to the station to kill the three to preserve the signal jamming. Mikhail arrives and kills Greta and Bonnie, only to be shot through the chest with a spear gun by Desmond who emerges from a closet inside the station where he had hidden after diving down a short time after Charlie did. Getting the code from Bonnie before she dies -LRB-the notes to the middle eight of ``Good Vibrations'' by the Beach Boys-RRB-, Charlie disables the signal jammer, and is contacted by Penny Widmore -LRB-Sonya Walger-RRB- via video transmission. Penny informs Charlie that she does not know Naomi, and did not send the boat that Naomi claims to be from. Despite his injury, Mikhail manages to swim out of the station and blasts the window of the jamming room with a grenade, killing himself and flooding the communications room. Charlie locks the door to save Desmond from drowning with him, but before he drowns, Charlie writes on his hand so Desmond can read: ``NOT PENNY'S BOAT''. John Locke -LRB-Terry O'Quinn-RRB-, one of the survivors, has been shot by Ben. Finding his legs paralyzed again, Locke is about to commit suicide, when he is stopped by what appears to be Walt Lloyd -LRB-Malcolm David Kelley-RRB-. Meanwhile, Ben tells Richard Alpert -LRB-Nestor Carbonell-RRB- to lead the rest of the Others to the ``Temple'' and then leaves the Others with his adopted daughter, Alex -LRB-Tania Raymonde-RRB- Rousseau's daughter and Karl's girlfriend, to meet up with the survivors to persuade Jack not to call Naomi's ship for rescue. Jack informs Kate Austen -LRB-Evangeline Lilly-RRB- that he loves her, after she witnesses a kiss between him and Juliet. Ben and Alex intercept Jack's group; Ben informs Jack that Naomi is not who she says she is, and making contact with her boat will be disastrous for everyone on the island. Ben orders the shooting of Sayid, Jin, and Bernard, and when Jack hears three shots, he attacks Ben and punches him in the face repeatedly leaving Ben bloody. Unknown to Jack, the shots were fired into the sand, following earlier orders from Ben. Rousseau meets her sixteen year old daughter Alex, who was kidnapped by the Others shortly after her birth, and they tie Ben up. The trek party, now able to get a signal, arrives at the radio tower. Rousseau disables her distress signal, freeing the frequency for Naomi. However, Naomi is knifed in the back by Locke, who threatens to kill Jack if he calls Naomi's boat. Locke cannot bring himself to kill Jack, who communicates with George Minkowski on Naomi's boat. Minkowski tells the survivors they will be sending rescue. Throughout the episode, flashforwards from years after ``Through the Looking Glass'''s island events show that Jack has escaped the island and returned to work as a spinal surgeon, although it's not till the last one when Kate appears and Jack discusses the island that it becomes clear that they are flashforwards rather than flashbacks. He is depressed, bearded, heavily drinking and addicted to Oxycodone. After reading about the death of someone he knew, Jack goes to commit suicide by jumping off the Sixth Street Viaduct bridge. He is distracted by a car wreck and goes to save those in need. Jack visits the memorial service for the person he read about and finds himself to be the only attendee. Jack contacts Kate and tells her about the memorial service. Kate says that she did not know about it, but she would not have attended even if she did. Jack also confesses to using the ``golden pass'' that they were given by Oceanic Airlines to fly across the Pacific Ocean and back every Friday, hoping that he will crash on the island. Jack explains that they should never have left the island and must return; however, Kate disagrees and leaves, not wanting to continue this conversation that they have apparently had before. -LSB-edit-RSB- Production The title is an allusion to Lewis Carroll's novel Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There and a reference to the fictitious Dharma Initiative station found in the previous episode. Shooting began on April 13, 2007 and ended on May 7, 2007. The writers were so far behind schedule that parts of the episode were shot while later parts were still being written. Filming mostly took place on Oahu, Hawaii, with additional scenes shot in Los Angeles. The hospital scenes were filmed on the same sets used for the ABC show Grey's Anatomy. Despite not being mentioned in the official press release, then 15 year old Malcolm David Kelley returned to reprise his role as 10 year old Walt Lloyd, and received credit as a ``special guest star''. Kelley's character had left the island in the second season finale, only 26 days prior to the events of ``Through the Looking Glass'', however, Kelley had not filmed an episode in over a year. In his single scene, Walt has visibly aged, appears taller and has a deeper voice. The producers had hoped that Harold Perrineau, who plays Walt's father Michael Dawson, would return in this episode, but he was busy filming the pilot for CBS' Demons. Perrineau instead returned to Lost in season 4. Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse lent their voices for the unseen roles of the flight captain and newscaster, respectively. This episode concluded the story arc about Charlie's death, which began earlier in the season when Desmond prophesied Charlie's death. Throughout the season, Charlie escaped death; however, Desmond told Charlie that he had to die in order for his girlfriend, Claire Littleton, to get rescued from the island. The storyline of Charlie's death was conceived while producing the latter part of the second season, after the storyline of Charlie's drug addiction finished. The news of his character's death was broken to Monaghan two episodes in advance, to which Monaghan felt ``relief'' for knowing the future of his job on the show. On the night of Monaghan's second to last day on set, he was presented with a canoe paddle that had been made by the cast and crew. Monaghan hoped to return to Lost as a guest star in flashbacks or dreams. Jack Bender stated that Matthew Fox ``really commits body and soul into the story he's telling'' and Fox questioned whether he had ever been more tired than while shooting the double episode. Like the other Lost season finales, the final cliffhanger scene was given a codename--``The Rattlesnake in the Mailbox''--and kept top secret. After Lindelof and Cuse wrote the scene, only Fox, Lilly, Bender and co-executive producer Jean Higgins were given copies of the script. The scene was shot with a green screen in an abandoned Honolulu parking lot with the airport edited in. Despite the security measures, a complete and detailed episode synopsis was uploaded online over a week before the episode aired. The leak prompted Lindelof and Cuse to enter ``radio silence'', which was temporarily broken at Comic-Con International 2007. The funeral parlor that Jack visits is called ``Hoffs/Drawlar'', which is an anagram of ``flashforward''. The idea of flashforwards was conceived by creators Lindelof and Abrams during the show's conception. However, Cuse and Lindelof only started fleshing out the idea at the end of the first season, after they realized that flashbacks would eventually stop being revelatory and knew that they would eventually have to switch to flashforwards. With the announcement that the series would conclude 48 episodes after ``Through the Looking Glass'', they felt comfortable playing flashforwards as early as the third season finale. Post-production wrapped on May 21, 2007, only two days before it aired on television. The score was composed by series musician Michael Giacchino, while popular music was also featured throughout the episode. Charlie also sings a song in the episode that was written by Dominic Monaghan, who plays him. A Lost season finale is approximately twice as long the average Lost episode. Due to the episode's length, it was split into two parts in some countries and when released on DVD. Unlike most episodes, this episode did not feature a ``previously on Lost...'' recap at the start of the episode when it first aired; however, it was originally preceded by a clip-show titled ``Lost: The Answers'', which recapped the third season. Cuse said that he and Lindelof think the finale is ``very cool -LSB-and-RSB- we're very proud of it.'' Stephen McPherson, the president of ABC Entertainment, called ``Through the Looking Glass'' ``one of the best episodes'' of the series. Buena Vista Home Entertainment released ``Through the Looking Glass'' on the season's DVD and Blu-ray Disc sets on December 11, 2007 in Region 1. A featurette called ``Lost: On Location'' features cast and crew discussing production of select episodes, including ``Through the Looking Glass''. The episode was rerun for the first time on January 30, 2008 with on-screen text in the lower third of the screen, similar to VH1's Pop-up Video. These pop-ups were not written by Lost's writers due to the 2007--2008 Writers Guild of America strike; they were written by the marketing company Met/Hodder. This enhanced edition was viewed by almost 9 million Americans. -LSB-edit-RSB- Reception -LSB-edit-RSB- Ratings In the U.S., the episode brought in the best ratings for Lost in fifteen episodes. The two-hour Wednesday broadcast on ABC made Lost the fourth most watched series of the week with an average of 13.86 million American viewers, below the third season average of 14.6 million. The first hour was viewed by 12.67 million, and the audience increased to 15.04 million in the second hour. The episode received a 5.9/15 in the key adults 18--49 demographic. In the United Kingdom, the episode attracted 1.21 million viewers, and was the second most watched program of the week on the non-terrestrial channels, beaten only by Katie & Peter: The Next Chapter. In Australia, Lost was the thirty-seventh most viewed show of the week, bringing in 1.17 million viewers. In Canada, the episode placed sixteenth for the first half, with 911,000 viewers and fifteenth for the second half, with 938,000 viewers. The episodes were broadcast before and after American Idol. -LSB-edit-RSB- Critical response The episode garnered critical acclaim. The Los Angeles Times wrote that the episode was ``an unusually action-packed and sanguinary spring cleaning that... left a host of... characters... dead'', Access Atlanta said ``it was deeply satisfying. The first hour started a bit slow but the second hour had great twists, wonderfully emotional moments, both happy and sad'', and the Associated Press said that ``the powerful season-ending episode redeemed the series with the shrewdness and intrigue that made it so addictive in the first place.'' The San Francisco Chronicle wrote that ``not only was the pace fast, the teases taut, and the answers plenty, the writers took a compelling gamble... -LSB-by telling-RSB- viewers that in the future... maybe all... of the people on the Lost island get off. But in Jack, our guide through this series, the writers definitively say, `Be careful what you wish for.''' The San Jose Mercury News called the finale a ``jaw-dropping exercise in good storytelling.'' The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette commented that the flashforward ``twist gave the saga renewed momentum as it begins its march toward a 2010 finish.'' The season finale was summed up as ``a mind-blower, for sure, a radical two hours that gave us major fake-outs, an army of dead bodies, the possibility of rescue -LSB-and-RSB- diverse portraits of heroism'' by The Boston Globe, who added that the death of Charlie was ``the most touching loss of the series so far.'' The Palm Beach Post and Wizard named it the ``Best Cliffhanger'' of 2007. The Chicago Tribune called it ``a qualified success'' with excellent pacing and action, however, the flashforward scenes were thought to be uninteresting and ``clumsy''. Time ranked the episode as the best of 2007 and the ``Rattlesnake in the Mailbox'' as one of the ten best scenes of 2007 television. The Futon Critic placed the episode first in the site's annual ``50 Best Episodes'' list. E! said that ``Through the Looking Glass'' was possibly ``the best episode ever of the entire series.'' TV Guide described ``Through the Looking Glass'' as ``a dizzying exercise in adventure, sustained tension and time-shifting rug pulling -LSB-that was-RSB- spectacularly produced, amazingly directed and gloriously acted.'' IGN gave the double episode a perfect 10/10 -- the best review of the season -- saying it was ``nothing short of a masterpiece of storytelling with a brilliantly paced narrative.'' IGN would conclude that the flashforward was the ``Biggest Shock'' in 2007 television. BuddyTV praised the unpredictability, saying that ``no other show can even attempt to do what Lost does.'' BuddyTV would later call ``Through the Looking Glass'' the best finale of 2007 and Charlie's death the saddest TV death of 2007. ``Through the Looking Glass'' was TV.com's ``Editor's Choice'' for ``Best Episode'' of 2007. AOL's TV Squad gave the episode a 7/7, noting that ``the writers followed through on Desmond's premonitions and successfully delivered the highly anticipated game-changer.'' Television Without Pity gave the third season finale an ``A''. The Sydney Morning Herald wrote that Lost ``may have unjumped -LSB-the shark-RSB- with -LSB-the-RSB- flashforward.'' Entertainment Weekly ranked it as one of the top ten episodes of 2007, saying that the cliffhanger ''-LSB-revealed-RSB- new dimensions to -LSB-Lost's-RSB- creative world.'' Zap2It questioned ``whether to be deeply frustrated -LRB-again-RRB-, really, really confused -LRB-a distinct possibility-RRB- or just in awe of the incredible mind--LRB-ahem-RRB- show runners... have pulled off.'' The writing for Locke was criticized, and one IGN writer said that ``it seems irrational that he would go and -LSB-stab Naomi-RSB- in the back without explaining himself.'' Lindelof stated ``that we might be willing to give -LSB-Locke-RSB- the benefit of the doubt for any action he took in response to -LSB-lying, gutshot, in a pit of Dharma corpses for two days and on the verge of taking his own life-RSB-, even if considered slightly `out of character'.'' Film and television director and writer Kevin Smith said that ``to do seasons and then suddenly throw a massive curveball is just so dramatically satisfying, you just take your hats off to the writers in a big, bad way.'' -LSB-edit-RSB- Awards The episode was nominated in the categories of ``Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series'', ``Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series'' and ``Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Drama Series'' for the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards, but it failed to win in any category. The season finale was submitted for Emmy consideration in the category of ``Outstanding Drama Series''; however, it was not nominated. Bender was also nominated for the Directors Guild of America Award for ``Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Dramatic Series Night'', but he did not win. ``Through the Looking Glass'' was the AOL primetime poll winner and editors' pick for ``Best Season-Ending Cliffhanger''. ``Through the Looking Glass'' won ``Drama Episode of the Year'' at the Los Angeles Times Gold Derby TV Awards. The episode was awarded three E! Tater Top Awards. Charlie's death won ``Biggest Tearjerker'' and the ``Rattlesnake'' won ``Biggest Shocker'', while Rose Henderson won ``Best Line'' for ``If you say `live together, die alone' to me, Jack, I'm going to punch you in your face.''

Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse lent their voices for the unseen roles of the flight captain and newscaster, respectively. Amateur career Early years Earvin Johnson Jr. was born to Earvin Sr., a General Motors assembly worker, and Christine, a school custodian. Johnson grew up in Lansing, Michigan, and came to love basketball as a youngster, idolizing players such as Earl Monroe and Marques Haynes, and practicing ``all day''. Johnson was first dubbed ``Magic'' as a 15-year-old sophomore playing for Lansing's Everett High School, when he recorded a triple-double of 36�points, 18�rebounds and 16�assists. After the game, Fred Stabley Jr., a sports writer for the Lansing State Journal, gave him the moniker despite the belief of Johnson's mother, a Christian, that the name was sacrilegious. In his final high school season, Johnson led Lansing Everett to a 27--1 win--loss record while averaging 28.8�points and�16.8 rebounds per game, and took his team to an overtime victory in the state championship game. Michigan State University Although Johnson was recruited by several top-ranked colleges such as Indiana and UCLA, he decided to play close to home. He initially wanted to attend the University of Michigan, but decided on Michigan State University in East Lansing, after the school's basketball coach, Jud Heathcote, promised that Johnson could play the point guard position. Johnson did not initially aspire to play professionally, focusing instead on his communication studies major and on his desire to become a television commentator. Playing with future NBA draftees Greg Kelser, Jay Vincent and Mike Brkovich, Johnson averaged 17.0�points, 7.9�rebounds, and 7.4�assists per game as a freshman, and led the Spartans to a 25--5�record, the Big Ten Conference title, and a berth in the 1978 NCAA Tournament. The Spartans reached the Elite Eight, but lost narrowly to eventual national champion Kentucky. During the 1978--79 season, Michigan State again qualified for the NCAA Tournament, where they advanced to the championship game and faced Indiana State University, which was led by senior Larry Bird. In what was the most-watched college basketball game ever, Michigan State defeated Indiana State 75--64, and Johnson was voted Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four. After two years in college, during which he averaged 17.1�points, 7.6�rebounds, and 7.9�assists per game, Johnson declared himself eligible for the 1979 NBA Draft. Professional career Rookie season in the NBA -LRB-1979--80-RRB- Johnson was drafted first overall in 1979 by the Los Angeles Lakers. Johnson said that what was ``most amazing'' about joining the Lakers was the chance to play alongside Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the team's 7�ft 2�in -LRB-2.18�m-RRB- center who became the leading scorer in NBA history. Despite Abdul-Jabbar's dominance, he had failed to win a championship with the Lakers, and Johnson was expected to help them achieve that goal. Johnson averaged 18.0�points, 7.7�rebounds, and 7.3�assists per game for the season, was selected to the NBA All-Rookie Team, and was named an NBA All-Star Game starter. The Lakers compiled a 60--22�record in the regular season and reached the 1980 NBA Finals, in which they faced the Philadelphia 76ers, who were led by forward Julius Erving. The Lakers took a 3--2�lead in the series, but Abdul-Jabbar, who averaged 33�points a game in the series, sprained his ankle in Game 5 and could not play in Game 6. Paul Westhead decided to start Johnson at center in Game 6; Johnson recorded 42�points, 15�rebounds, seven�assists, and three steals in a 123--107 win, while playing guard, forward, and center at different times during the game. Johnson became the only rookie to win the NBA Finals MVP award, and his clutch performance is still regarded as one of the finest in NBA history. He also became one of four players to win NCAA and NBA championships in consecutive years. Ups and downs -LRB-1980--83-RRB- Early in the 1980--81 season, Johnson was sidelined after he suffered torn cartilage in his left knee. He missed 45�games, and said that his rehabilitation was the ``most down'' he had ever felt. Johnson returned before the start of the 1981 playoffs, but the Lakers' then-assistant and future head coach Pat Riley later said Johnson's much-anticipated return made the Lakers a ``divided team''. The 54-win Lakers faced the 40--42 Houston Rockets in the first round of playoffs, where Houston upset the Lakers 2--1 after Johnson airballed a last-second shot in Game 3. During the off-season, Johnson signed a 25-year, $25�million contract with the Lakers, which was the highest-paying contract in sports history up to that point. At the beginning of the 1981--82 season, Johnson had a heated dispute with Westhead, who Johnson said made the Lakers ``slow'' and ``predictable''. After Johnson demanded to be traded, Lakers owner Jerry Buss fired Westhead and replaced him with Riley. Although Johnson denied responsibility for Westhead's firing, he was booed across the league, even by Lakers' fans. Despite his off-court troubles, Johnson averaged 18.6�points, 9.6�rebounds, 9.5�assists, and a league-high 2.7�steals per game, and was voted a member of the All-NBA Second Team. He also joined Wilt Chamberlain and Oscar Robertson as the only NBA players to tally at least 700�points, 700�rebounds, and 700�assists in the same season. The Lakers advanced through the 1982 playoffs and faced Philadelphia for the second time in three years in the 1982 NBA Finals. After a triple-double from Johnson in Game 6, the Lakers defeated the Sixers 4--2, as Johnson won his second NBA Finals MVP award. During the championship series against the Sixers, Johnson averaged 16.2�points on .533�shooting, 10.8�rebounds, 8.0�assists, and 2.5�steals per game. Johnson later said that his third season was when the Lakers first became a great team, and he credited their success to Riley. During the 1982--83 NBA season, Johnson averaged 16.8�points, 10.5�assists, and 8.6�rebounds per game and earned his first All-NBA First Team nomination. The Lakers again reached the Finals, and for a third time faced the Sixers, who featured center Moses Malone as well as Erving. With Johnson's teammates Norm Nixon, James Worthy and Bob McAdoo all hobbled by injuries, the Lakers were swept by the Sixers, and Malone was crowned the Finals MVP. In a losing effort against Philadelphia, Johnson averaged 19.0�points on .403�shooting, 12.5�assists, and 7.8�rebounds per game. Battles against the Celtics -LRB-1983--87-RRB- In Johnson's fifth season, he averaged a double-double of 17.6�points and 13.1�assists, as well as 7.3�rebounds per game. The Lakers reached the Finals for the third year in a row, where Johnson's Lakers and Bird's Celtics met for the first time in the post-season. The Lakers won the first game, and led by two points in Game 2 with 18�seconds to go, but after a layup by Gerald Henderson, Johnson failed to get a shot off before the final buzzer sounded, and the Lakers lost 124--121 in overtime. In Game 3, Johnson responded with 21�assists in a 137--104 win, but in Game 4, he again made several crucial errors late in the contest. In the final minute of the game, Johnson had the ball stolen by Celtics center Robert Parish, and then missed two free throws that could have won the game. The Celtics won Game 4 in overtime, and the teams split the next two games. In the decisive Game 7 in Boston, as the Lakers trailed by three points in the final minute, opposing point guard Dennis Johnson stole the ball from Johnson, a play that effectively ended the series. During the Finals, Johnson averaged 18.0�points on .560�shooting, 13.6�assists, and 7.7�rebounds per game. Johnson later described the series as ``the one championship we should have had but didn't get''. In the regular season, Johnson averaged 18.3�points, 12.6�assists, and 6.2�rebounds per game and led the Lakers into the 1985 NBA Finals, where they faced the Celtics again. The series started poorly for the Lakers when they allowed an NBA Finals record 148�points to the Celtics in a 34-point loss in Game 1. However, Abdul-Jabbar, who was now 38�years old, scored 30�points and grabbed 17�rebounds in Game 2, and his 36�points in a Game 5 win were instrumental in establishing a 3--2 lead for Los Angeles. After the Lakers defeated the Celtics in six games, Abdul-Jabbar and Johnson, who averaged 18.3�points on .494�shooting, 14.0�assists, and 6.8�rebounds per game in the championship series, said the Finals win was the highlight of their careers. Johnson again averaged a double-double in the 1985--86 NBA season, with 18.8�points, 12.6�assists, and 5.9�rebounds per game. The Lakers advanced to the Western Conference Finals, but were unable to defeat Houston, who advanced to the Finals in five games. In the next season, Johnson averaged a career-high of 23.9�points, as well as 12.2�assists and 6.3�rebounds per game, and earned his first regular season MVP award. The Lakers met the Celtics for the third time in the NBA Finals, and in Game 4 Johnson hit a last-second hook shot over Celtics big men Parish and Kevin McHale to win the game 107--106. The game-winning shot, which Johnson dubbed his ``junior, junior, junior sky-hook'', helped Los Angeles defeat Boston in six games. Johnson was awarded his third Finals MVP title after averaging 26.2�points on .541�shooting, 13.0�assists, 8.0�rebounds, and 2.33�steals per game. Repeat and falling short -LRB-1987--91-RRB- Before the 1987--88 NBA season, Lakers coach Pat Riley publicly promised that they would defend the NBA title, even though a team had not won consecutive titles since the 1969 NBA Finals. Johnson had another productive season with averages of 19.6�points, 11.9�assists, and 6.2�rebounds per game. In the 1988 playoffs, the Lakers survived two 4--3�series against the Utah Jazz and the Dallas Mavericks to reach the Finals and face the Detroit Pistons, known as the ``Bad Boys'' for their physical style of play. After the teams split the first six games, Lakers forward and Finals MVP James Worthy had his first career triple-double of 36�points, 16�rebounds, and 10�assists, and led his team to a 108--105�win. Despite not being named MVP, Johnson had a strong championship series, averaging 21.1�points on .550�shooting, 13.0�assists, and 5.7�rebounds per game. In the 1988--89 NBA season, Johnson's 22.5�points, 12.8�assists, and 7.9�rebounds per game earned him his second MVP award, and the Lakers reached the 1989 NBA Finals, in which they again faced the Pistons. However, after Johnson went down with a hamstring injury in Game 2, the Lakers were no match for the Pistons, who swept them 4--0. Playing without the retired Abdul-Jabbar for the first time, Johnson won his third MVP award after a strong 1989--90 NBA season in which he averaged 22.3�points, 11.5�assists, and 6.6�rebounds per game. However, the Lakers bowed out to the Phoenix Suns in the Western Conference semifinals, which was the Lakers' earliest playoffs elimination in nine years. Johnson performed well during the 1990--91 NBA season, with averages of 19.4�points, 12.5�assists, and 7.0�rebounds per game, and the Lakers reached the 1991 NBA Finals. There they faced the Chicago Bulls, led by shooting guard Michael Jordan, a five-time scoring champion regarded as the finest player of his era. Although the series was portrayed as a matchup between Johnson and Jordan, Bulls forward Scottie Pippen primarily defended against Johnson, doing an effective job. Despite two triple-doubles from Johnson during the series, Finals MVP Jordan led his team to a 4--1�win. In the last championship series of his career, Johnson averaged 18.6�points on .431�shooting, 12.4�assists, and 8.0�rebounds per game. HIV announcement and Olympics -LRB-1991--92-RRB- After a physical before the 1991--92 NBA season, Johnson discovered that he had tested positive for HIV. In a press conference held on November�7, 1991, Johnson made a public announcement that he would retire immediately. He stated that his wife Cookie and their unborn child did not have HIV, and that he would dedicate his life to ``battle this deadly disease''. Johnson initially said that he did not know how he contracted the disease, but later admitted that it was through having multiple sexual partners during his playing career. At the time, only a small percentage of HIV-positive people had contracted it from heterosexual sex, and it was initially rumored that Johnson was gay or bisexual, although he denied both. Johnson's announcement became a major news story in the United States, and in 2004 was named as ESPN's seventh most memorable moment of the past 25 years. Many articles praised Johnson as a hero, and former U.S. President George H. W. Bush said, ``For me, Magic is a hero, a hero for anyone who loves sports.'' Despite his retirement, Johnson was voted by fans as a starter for the 1992 NBA All-Star Game, although his former teammates Byron Scott and A. C. Green said that Johnson should not play, and several NBA players, including Utah Jazz forward Karl Malone, argued that they would be at risk of contamination if Johnson suffered an open wound while on court. Johnson led the West to a 153--113�win and was crowned All-Star MVP after recording 25�points, 9�assists, and 5�rebounds. The game ended after he made a last-minute three-pointer, and players from both teams ran onto the court to congratulate Johnson. Johnson was chosen to compete in the 1992 Summer Olympics for the US basketball team, dubbed the ``Dream Team'' because of the NBA stars on the roster. During the tournament, which the USA won easily, Johnson played infrequently because of knee problems, but he received standing ovations from the crowd, and used the opportunity to inspire HIV-positive people. Post-Olympics and later life Before the 1992--93 NBA season, Johnson announced his intention to stage an NBA comeback. After practicing and playing in several pre-season games, he returned to retirement before the start of the regular season, citing controversy over his return sparked by opposition from several active players. During his retirement, Johnson has written a book on safer sex, run several businesses, worked for NBC as a commentator, and toured Asia and Australia with a basketball team that comprised former college and NBA players. He returned to the NBA as coach of the Lakers near the end of the 1993--94 NBA season, replacing Randy Pfund. After losing five of six games, Johnson announced he would resign after the season, choosing instead to purchase a 5% share of the team in June 1994. In the following season, at the age of 36, Johnson attempted another comeback as a player. Playing power forward, he averaged 14.6�points, 6.9�assists, and 5.7�rebounds per game in the last 32�games of the season. After the Lakers lost to the Houston Rockets in the first round of the playoffs, Johnson retired permanently, saying, ``I am going out on my terms, something I couldn't say when I aborted a comeback in 1992.'' Off the court Personal life Johnson first fathered a son in 1981, when Andre Johnson was born to Melissa Mitchell. Although Andre was raised by his mother, he visited Johnson each summer, and as of October 2005 was working for Magic Johnson Enterprises as a marketing director. In 1991, Johnson married Earlitha ``Cookie'' Kelly, with whom he had one son, Earvin III; the couple adopted a daughter, Elisa, in 1995. Media figure and business interests In 1998, Johnson hosted a late night talk show on the Fox network called The Magic Hour, but the show was canceled after two months because of low ratings. He runs Magic Johnson Enterprises, a company that has a net worth of $700�million; its subsidiaries include Magic Johnson Productions, a promotional company; Magic Johnson Theaters, a nationwide chain of movie theaters; and Magic Johnson Entertainment, a movie studio. Johnson has also worked as a motivational speaker. He is a supporter of the Democratic Party--in 2005, he publicly endorsed Phil Angelides for governor of California, and Hillary Clinton for president of the United States. Johnson was an NBA commentator for Turner Network Television for seven years, before becoming a studio analyst for ESPN's NBA Countdown in 2008. Since 1994, Johnson has been a minority owner of the Lakers, having reportedly paid more than $10�million for part ownership. He also holds the title of team vice president. In 2006 Johnson created a contract food service with Sodexo USA called Sodexo-Magic. HIV activism After announcing his infection in November 1991, Johnson created the Magic Johnson Foundation to help combat HIV, although he later diversified the foundation to include other charitable goals. In 1992, he joined the National Commission on AIDS, but left after eight months, saying that the commission was not doing enough to combat the disease. He was also the main speaker for the United Nations -LRB-UN-RRB- World AIDS Day Conference in 1999, and has served as a United Nations Messenger of Peace. HIV had been associated with drug addicts and homosexuals, but Johnson's campaigns sought to show that the risk of infection was not limited to those groups. Johnson stated that his aim was to ``help educate all people about what -LSB-HIV-RSB- is about'' and teach others not to ``discriminate against people who have HIV and AIDS''. Johnson was later criticized by the AIDS community for his decreased involvement in publicizing the spread of the disease. To prevent his HIV infection from becoming AIDS, Johnson takes a daily combination of drugs. He has advertised GlaxoSmithKline's drugs, and partnered with Abbott Laboratories to publicize the fight against AIDS in African American communities. Career achievements In 905�NBA games, Johnson scored 17,707�points, 6,559�rebounds, and 10,141�assists, translating to career averages of 19.5�points, 7.2�rebounds, and 11.2�assists per game. Johnson shares the single-game playoff record for assists -LRB-24-RRB-, holds the Finals record for assists in a game -LRB-21-RRB-, and has the most playoff assists -LRB-2,346-RRB-. He holds the All-Star Game single-game record for assists -LRB-22-RRB-, and the All-Star Game record for career assists -LRB-127-RRB-. Johnson introduced a fast-paced style of basketball called ``Showtime'', described as a mix of ``no-look passes off the fastbreak, pin-point alley-oops from halfcourt, spinning feeds and overhand bullets under the basket through triple teams.'' Fellow Lakers guard Michael Cooper said, ``There have been times when -LSB-Johnson-RSB- has thrown passes and I wasn't sure where he was going. Then one of our guys catches the ball and scores, and I run back up the floor convinced that he must've thrown it through somebody.'' Johnson was exceptional because he played point guard despite being 6�ft 9�in -LRB-2.06�m-RRB-, a size reserved normally for frontcourt players. He combined the size of a power forward, the one-on-one skills of a swingman, and the ball handling talent of a guard, making him one of the most dangerous triple-double threats of all time; his 138�triple-double games are second only to Oscar Robertson's 181. For his feats, Johnson was voted as one of the 50 Greatest Players of All Time by the NBA in 1996, and was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2002. ESPN's SportsCentury ranked Johnson #17 in their ``50 Greatest Athletes of the 20th Century'' In 2006, ESPN.com rated Johnson the greatest point guard of all time, stating, ``It could be argued that he's the one player in NBA history who was better than Michael Jordan.'' Several of his achievements in individual games have also been named among the top moments in the NBA. Rivalry with Larry Bird Johnson and Bird were first linked as rivals after Johnson's Michigan State squad defeated Bird's Indiana State team in the 1979 NCAA finals. The rivalry continued in the NBA, and reached its climax when Boston and Los Angeles met in three out of four NBA Finals from 1984 to 1987. Johnson asserted that for him, the 82-game regular season was composed of 80 normal games, and two Lakers--Celtics games. Similarly, Bird admitted that Johnson's daily box score was the first thing he checked in the morning. Several journalists hypothesized that the Johnson--Bird rivalry was so appealing because it represented many other contrasts, such as the clash between the Lakers and Celtics, between Hollywood flashiness -LRB-``Showtime''-RRB- and Boston/Indiana blue collar grit -LRB-``Celtic Pride''-RRB-, and between blacks and whites. The rivalry was also significant because it drew national attention to the faltering NBA. Prior to Johnson and Bird's arrival, the NBA had gone through a decade of declining interest and low TV ratings. With the two future Hall of Famers, the league won a whole generation of new fans, drawing both traditionalist adherents of Bird's dirt court Indiana game and those appreciative of Johnson's public park flair. Sports journalist Larry Schwartz of ESPN asserted that Johnson and Bird saved the NBA from bankruptcy. Despite their on-court rivalry, Johnson and Bird became good friends; ironically, they became close during the filming of a 1984 Converse shoe advertisement that depicted them as enemies. Johnson appeared at Bird's retirement ceremony in 1992, and described Bird as a ``friend forever''; during Johnson's Hall of Fame ceremony, Bird formally inducted his old rival. Works Biographies Johnson's autobiography is Johnson, Earvin -LRB-1992-RRB-. After the teams split the first six games, Lakers forward and Finals MVP James Worthy had his first career triple-double of 36�points, 16�rebounds, and 10�assists, and led his team to a 108--105�win.

After two years in college, during which he averaged 17.1�points, 7.6�rebounds, and 7.9�assists per game, Johnson declared himself eligible for the 1979 NBA Draft. The rivalry continued in the NBA, and reached its climax when Boston and Los Angeles met in three out of four NBA Finals from 1984 to 1987. In the next season, Johnson averaged a career-high of 23.9�points, as well as 12.2�assists and 6.3�rebounds per game, and earned his first regular season MVP award. In his final high school season, Johnson led Lansing Everett to a 27--1 win--loss record while averaging 28.8�points and�16.8 rebounds per game, and took his team to an overtime victory in the state championship game.

Later that year, Mukul Bose -LRB-2HQ-RRB- became the second ham operator, thereby introducing the first two-way ham radio communication in the country. By 1923, there were twenty British hams operating in India. In 1929, the call sign prefix VU came into effect in India, replacing three-letter call signs. The first short-wave entertainment and public broadcasting station, ``VU6AH'', was set up in 1935 by E P Metcalfe, vice-chancellor of Mysore University. However, there were fewer than fifty licence holders in the mid-1930s, most of them British officers in the Indian army. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the British cancelled the issue of new licences. All amateur radio operators were sent written orders to surrender their transmitting equipment to the police, both for possible use in the war effort and to prevent the clandestine use of the stations by Axis collaborators and spies. With the gaining momentum of the Indian independence movement, ham operator Nariman Abarbad Printer -LRB-VU2FU-RRB- set up the Azad Hind Radio to broadcast Gandhian protest music and uncensored news; he was immediately arrested and his equipment seized. In August 1942, after Mahatma Gandhi launched the Quit India Movement, the British began clamping down on the activities of Indian independence activists and censoring the media. To circumvent media restrictions, Indian National Congress activists, led by Usha Mehta, contacted Mumbai-based amateur radio operators, ``Bob'' Tanna -LRB-VU2LK-RRB- and Nariman Printer to help broadcast messages to grass-roots party workers across the country. The radio service was called the ``Congress Radio'', and began broadcasting from 2 September, 1942 on 7.12�MHz. The station could be received as far as Japanese-occupied Myanmar. By November 1942, Tanna was betrayed by an unknown radio officer and was forced to shut down the station. Temporary amateur radio licences were issued from 1946, after the end of World War II. By 1948, there were 50 amateur radio operators in India, although only a dozen were active. Following India's independence in 1947, the first amateur radio organization, the Amateur Radio Club of India was inaugurated on 15 May 1948 at the School of Signals at Mhow in Madhya Pradesh. The club headquarters was later moved to New Delhi, where it was renamed the Amateur Radio Society of India -LRB-ARSI-RRB- on 15 May, 1954. As India's oldest amateur radio organization, ARSI became its representative at the International Amateur Radio Union. Partly due to low awareness among the general population and prohibitive equipment costs, the number of licensed amateur radio operators did not increase significantly over the next two decades, numbering fewer than a thousand by 1970. CW -LRB-Morse code-RRB- and AM were the predominant modes at that time. The electronic equipment was mostly valve-based, obtained from Indian army surpluses. During the mid-1960s, the modes of operation saw a change from Amplitude Modulation to Single Side Band -LRB-SSB-RRB- as the preferred communication mode. By 1980, the number of amateur radio operators had risen to 1,500. In 1984, then Indian Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi, waived the import duty for wireless equipment. After this, the number of operators rose steadily, and by 2000 there were 10,000 licensed ham operators. As of 2007-LSB-update-RSB-, there are more than 16,000 ham radio operators in India. Amateur radio operators have played a significant part in disaster management and emergencies. In 1991, during the Gulf War, a lone Indian ham operator in Kuwait, provided the only means of communication between stranded Indian nationals in that country and their relatives in India. Amateur radio operators have also played a helpful part in disaster management. Shortly after the 1993 Latur and 2001 Gujarat earthquakes, the central government rushed teams of ham radio operators to the epicentre to provide vital communication links. In December 2004, a group of amateur radio operators on DX-pedition on the Andaman Islands witnessed the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami. With communication lines between the islands severed, the group provided the only way of relaying live updates and messages to stations across the world. In 2005, India became one of few countries to launch an amateur radio satellite, the HAMSAT. The Indian Space Research Organisation -LRB-ISRO-RRB- launched the microsatellite as an auxiliary payload on the PSLV-6. -LSB-edit-RSB- Licence categories The Indian Wireless Telegraph -LRB-Amateur Service-RRB- Rules, 1978 lists five licence categories:  To obtain a licence in the first four categories, candidates must pass the Amateur Station Operator's Certificate examination. This examination is held monthly in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai-RRB-, every two months in Ahmedabad, Nagpur and Hyderabad, and every four months in some smaller cities. The examination consists of two 50-mark written sections: Radio theory and practice, Regulations; and a practical test consisting of a demonstration of Morse code proficiency in both sending and receiving. After passing the examination, the candidate must then clear a police interview. After clearance, the WPC grants the licence along with the user-chosen call sign. This procedure can take up to 12 months. In a 2005 notification, the WPC proposed an amendment to the 1978 Amateur Service Rules in the rationalization of the licence categories to only two: the Amateur Wireless Telegraph Station Licence -LRB-General-RRB- and the Amateur Wireless Telegraph Station Licence -LRB-Restricted-RRB-. As of January 2010-LSB-update-RSB-, amendment has yet to be passed by the Parliament of India. -LSB-edit-RSB- Call-signs The International Telecommunication Union -LRB-ITU-RRB- has divided all countries into three regions; India is located in ITU Region 3. These regions are further divided into two competing zones, the ITU and the CQ. Mainland India and the Lakshadweep Islands come under ITU Zone�41 and CQ Zone�22, and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands under ITU Zone�49 and CQ Zone�26. The ITU has assigned to India call-sign blocks 8TA to 8YZ, VUA to VWZ, and ATA to AWZ. The WPC allots individual call-signs. Indian amateur radio operators are allotted only the VU call-sign prefix. The V or Viceroy, series prefix was allotted to British colonies. at the 1912 London International Radiotelegraphic Convention. VU call-signs are listed according to licence grade: for Advanced Grade and Grade--I licence holders, the call-sign prefix is VU2; for Grade--II and Grade--II Restricted licence holders, the prefix is VU3. The VU3 prefix has also been granted to foreigners operating in India. As of 2009-LSB-update-RSB-, call-signs consist of only letters, not numerals, and can be either two or three characters long. Examples of Indian amateur radio call-signs are ``VU2XY'' and ``VU2XYZ''. In addition to individual and club call-signs, the WPC allots temporary call-signs for contests and special events. For example, in November 2007, the WPC temporarily allotted the prefixes AT and AU to selected ham operators to mark the anniversary of the birth of radio scientist Jagadish Chandra Bose. The Indian Union territory -LRB-UT-RRB- of Andaman and Nicobar Islands are given the call-sign VU4 -LRB-VU4AN-RRB- and VU5; and the UT of Lakshadweep is given VU7 -LRB-VU7LD-RRB-. The WPC had temporarily allotted these call-signs to hamfests and DX-peditions held at those locations. Defunct call-signs include CR8 -LRB-for Portuguese India-RRB-, FN8 -LRB-for French India-RRB-, and AC3 -LRB-for the former kingdom of Sikkim, which merged with India in 1975-RRB-. -LSB-edit-RSB- Organizations The WPC is responsible for regulating amateur radio in India. The WPC has its headquarters in New Delhi with divisional offices in Mumbai -LRB-Bombay-RRB-, Kolkata -LRB-Calcutta-RRB-, and Chennai -LRB-Madras-RRB-. It also has monitoring stations in Ahmedabad, Nagpur, Hyderabad, Ajmer, Bangalore, Darjeeling, Gorakhpur, Jalandhar, Goa -LRB-Betim-RRB-, Mangalore, Shillong, Ranchi, Srinagar, Dibrugarh, Vishakapatnam, and Thiruvananthapuram. Set up in 1952, the organization is responsible for conducting exams, issuing licences, allotting frequency spectrum, and monitoring the airwaves. It is also responsible for maintaining the rules and regulations on amateur radio. In India, amateur radio is governed by the Indian Wireless Telegraphs -LRB-Amateur Service-RRB- Rules, 1978, the Indian Wireless Telegraph Rules, and the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885. The WPC is also responsible for coordinating with the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Intelligence Bureau in running background checks before issuing amateur radio licences. The Amateur Radio Society of India -LRB-ARSI-RRB-, based in Chennai, is a non-profit organization founded in 1954 that represents the interests of amateur radio operators before the India government, provides technical advice and assistance to amateur radio enthusiasts, and supports a number of educational programs throughout the country. ARSI is India's representative at the International Amateur Radio Union. Another notable organization is the non-governmental National Institute of Amateur Radio -LRB-NIAR-RRB-, based in Hyderabad. NIAR was established by the Ministry of Communications in 1983 to promote amateur radio in India. NIAR is also involved in amateur radio educational programs in the country and sponsors several DX-peditions. -LSB-edit-RSB- Allotted spectrum The following 14 frequency bands are permitted by the WPC for use by amateur radio operators in India. -LSB-edit-RSB- Awareness drives Indian amateur radio operators number just 16,000 for a population of 1.2 billion, or less than 0.002 percent of the population. Factors for the low numbers include low awareness, high equipment cost, and bureaucratic procedures in obtaining a licence where obtaining a licence can take over a year. After decades of lobbying to include ham radio in school syllabi, efforts paid off in 2006 after the Central Board of Secondary Education -LRB-CBSE-RRB- included ham radio in the chapter of Emergency communications on the subject of Disaster Management. The CBSE is one of the two national education boards. The President of India APJ Abdul Kalam, in a speech to the International Union of Radio Science held in New Delhi in 2005, stressed on the promotion of the hobby and setting up of ham stations in local panchayat offices, schools and hospitals. They would also act as early warning systems for the village communities in cases of emergencies. Amateur radio clubs across the country many join the hobby by organizing courses in preparation for the Amateur Station Operator's Certificate. The government-funded NIAR is one such organization that actively promotes the hobby by holding regular classes. The Vigyan Parishad, an apex body for science popularization under the Department of Science and Technology of the Government of India coordinates simulated disaster communication exercises and also organizes trainings to help people getting ham radio licenses in areas vulnerable to natural calamities. -LSB-edit-RSB- Activities and events Popular events and activities include Amateur Radio Direction Finding, DX-peditions, hamfests, JOTA, QRP operations, Contesting, DX communications, Light House operation, and Islands on Air. One of the most popular activities is Amateur Radio Direction Finding commonly known as a ``foxhunt''. Several clubs across India regularly organize foxhunts in which participants search for a hidden transmitter around the city. A foxhunt carried out in Matheran near Mumbai in 2005 by the Mumbai Amateur Radio Society was listed in the 2006 Limca Book of Records under the entry ``most ham operators on horseback on a foxhunt.'' Despite being a popular recreational activity among hams, no organization has yet participated in an international event. Hamfest India is an annual event that serves for social gathering and comparison and sales of radio equipment. Most hamfests feature a flea market, where the attendees buy and sell equipment, generally from and for their personal stations. The event also seeks to raise amateur radio awareness in the host city. In 2008, Gandhinagar hosted the annual hamfest. Bangalore hosted the hamfest in November 2009. The 2010 hamfest would be held at Pollachi, Tamil Nadu. Two special international hamfests were organized in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands -LRB-VU4-RRB- in 2006, and Lakshadweep -LRB-VU7-RRB- in January 2007. As amateur radio activity is not permitted on the two union territories due to security restrictions, special permissions were needed to be secured to host the event. The two events received widespread international participation through contests, DXing, and DX-peditions. Ham nets, where amateur radio operators ``check into'' are regularly conducted across India. Airnet India, Charminar Net, Belgaum Net, and Nite Owl's Net are some of the well-known ham nets in India. Some amateur radio operators have also provided a service of downloading and decoding satellite signals of the weather over India and publishing them on the internet as a public service. In Mumbai, ham operators also help in disaster management during the monsoon season when heavy rain disrupts general life there. In 2008, the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai, for the first time, formally included ham operators as part of the disaster management plan. Hams in Mumbai also help out at the annual Ganpati Visarjan by providing emergency radio services to civic organizations at the immersion points. The ``Island on the Air'' is another activity where ham enthusiasts visit remote islands and report on the conditions there, similar to DX-peditions. NIAR was established by the Ministry of Communications in 1983 to promote amateur radio in India. -LSB-edit-RSB- Activities and events Popular events and activities include Amateur Radio Direction Finding, DX-peditions, hamfests, JOTA, QRP operations, Contesting, DX communications, Light House operation, and Islands on Air. -LSB-edit-RSB- History The first amateur radio operator in India was Amarendra Chandra Gooptu -LRB-callsign 2JK-RRB-, licensed in 1921.

He was raised in a family of sportspeople. His mother Maree was a top runner and tennis player, and elder twins Adam and Troy were identified as talented footballers at a young age. As a two-year-old, Selwood was forced to wear splints on his leg to help overcome a walking disability. Selwood displayed athletic talent from an early age. He was the state hurdling champion from under-10s through to the under-15s, and in one year held every running and jumping record at the Bendigo Sports Centre, except the 100�metres sprint. Growing up with his older brothers, Selwood was accustomed to playing with bigger teammates and opponents. By the time he was eight years old, he had played his first competitive game of football, against children four years his senior, and had kicked three goals. Selwood played junior football with the Sandhurst Football Club, until he was chosen to play for the Bendigo Pioneers in the TAC Cup competition throughout 2006. Although his age made him ineligible to enter the 2005 AFL Draft, Selwood's accomplishments during the year led to AFL Talent Manager Kevin Sheehan rating him ``the best 17-year-old in Australia''. Selwood received an array of accolades and honours as a bottom-aged player, winning mid-year State honours for Victoria Country in the AFL National Championships. His performances in the championships earned him end-of-year All-Australian honours and the Most Valuable Player award for Victoria Country. In addition, he was named in the TAC Cup Team of the Year, awarded a scholarship within the prestigious AIS-AFL Academy, and subsequently captained his older teammates in the annual under-18s International Rules Series in Ireland. His performances in Ireland earned him the Ron Barassi Medal, as the adjudicated Most Valuable Player of the tour. Selwood's achievements in local football were recognised when he was listed as a finalist in the 2006 Bendigo Sports Star of the Year Award. Returning in 2006 with the Pioneers, Selwood entered his final year of junior football as one of the top rated prospects in his age group. His achievements at the junior level were recognised early by the AFL Player's Association, when he was awarded the Mike Fitzpatrick Scholarship, and the AFL Life Members Education Fund Award. Rewarded with the captaincy of Bendigo for his final season, Selwood again won mid-year State honours for Victoria Country. However, a knee injury occurred only six rounds into the competition forcing him to undergo surgery--his fourth knee operation within two years--prematurely ending his season. -LSB-edit-RSB- AFL career -LSB-edit-RSB- 2007: Debut Selwood was drafted by the Geelong Football Club with their first selection, and was the seventh overall draft pick in the 2006 AFL Draft. Although many recruiting scouts viewed him as ``the finest pure footballer in the draft'', and a potential top pick, there was still concern surrounding the durability of his knee. Nonetheless, as the equal highest-ever draft pick for the Cats, Selwood made his debut in the opening round of the 2007 AFL premiership season and missed only four games during the regular season. Selwood's transition to the AFL drew positive comments throughout the footballing community; former Brisbane coach Leigh Matthews noted how ``from -LSB-his-RSB- first game ... he looked like he had played 200 of them''. Geelong coach Mark Thompson labelled the 18-year-old Selwood the best youngster to have come under his tutelage during his time at the club. From the beginning, Selwood showed an ability to influence games; in just his fourth appearance he led his older and more experienced teammates with a game of 25�disposals and nine tackles. This achievement, described as inspiring, earned him an AFL Rising Star Award nomination. The Geelong coaching staff had a highlights package made of this performance, to screen to the rest of the team during the match review later that week. Selwood's impact on the game as a first--year player prompted numerous comparisons to Chris Judd, who a few years earlier had been lauded for his first-year success as an 18-year-old. At the conclusion of the home and away period, Selwood's regular contributions resulted in several individual accolades. Polling 44 out of a possible 45�votes, he was awarded the inaugural Ron Evans Medal as the winner of the AFL Rising Star Award. Selwood earned the maximum five votes from eight of the nine judges, the other awarding him four out of five. This meant that eight of the nine judges rated him as the best nominee. Selwood was also awarded the prestigious AFLPA Best First Year Player Award, winning over 70% of all votes from his peers. He became only the fourth player to win both the major awards for first--year players. Having helped Geelong finish first on the ladder and win the McClelland Trophy, Selwood made his finals debut in the 2nd Qualifying Final against the Kangaroos -LRB-now North Melbourne-RRB- at the Melbourne Cricket Ground -LRB-MCG-RRB-. In front of nearly 80,000�spectators, Selwood amassed 22�disposals, five marks, five clearances, six inside 50s, five tackles, and five score assists, helping Geelong to a club finals record 106�point victory. Although Selwood struggled to contribute in the Preliminary Final against Collingwood two weeks later, he returned to form for the 2007 AFL Grand Final at the MCG against Port Adelaide. With 18�disposals, five marks, five clearances--the most of any Geelong player--seven inside 50s, four tackles, and an equal game-high four score assists, Selwood helped the Cats to a record 119�point win. At 19�years of age, Selwood became the youngest person to play in a winning Grand Final team in 10�years. He was also the first to win the AFL Rising Star Award and play in a premiership side within the same season, making him one of the most accomplished first�year players in league history. Selwood's debut year achievements resulted in his becoming AFL's highest-paid first--year player. Selwood finished the season ranked first among all first--year players in several major statistical categories; total possessions -LRB-405-RRB-, disposals per game -LRB-19.3-RRB-, kicks -LRB-216-RRB-, handpasses -LRB-189-RRB-, marks -LRB-109-RRB-, tackles -LRB-94-RRB---the most ever by any first--year AFL player --and tackles per game -LRB-4.5-RRB-. His 23�score assists during the season also ranked him within the top ten in the league. Selwood added to his list of first�year honours at season's end with the Geelong Football Club Best First Year Player Award, along with a top 20 placing in the Club Champion award. He also received several media end�of�year sporting awards. -LSB-edit-RSB- 2008: ``Boy wonder'' Selwood continued to establish himself as a key player in the Geelong midfield during the 2008 AFL season, helping the Cats achieve a record-equalling 21-win season and secure the McClelland Trophy for the second successive year. Selwood also claimed the third--longest all-time winning streak by an individual player in VFL/AFL history; 25�successive wins before a mid-season loss to Collingwood. His standout season was rewarded when he was selected to play for Victoria in the AFL Hall of Fame Tribute Match All-Star event. In gaining selection for the Victorian team, Selwood, at 19�years of age, became the youngest player to represent ``The Big V'' in more than 12�years. He was also selected for the preliminary 2008 All-Australian squad, placed sixth for the Leigh Matthews Trophy as the AFLPA Most Valuable Player, and finished third in voting for the Robert Rose Most Courageous Player Award. Selwood also polled 19�votes in the Brownlow Medal, awarded to the ``best and fairest'' player in the AFL, to place fifth overall, and second among his teammates. Selwood's consistency and performances over his first two seasons was also recognised by the AFL Coaches Association, who awarded him the Best Young Player Award. Geelong qualified for the finals series and progressed to the Grand Final for the second consecutive year, but were defeated by Hawthorn. Selwood's performance in the final, during which he gathered 29�disposals--including a team-high nine contested possessions--six marks, six tackles, and six inside 50s, were recognised as he placed fourth in Norm Smith Medal voting for best afield in the Grand Final. Selwood's year, during which he averaged more than 25�disposals, 4�marks, and 4�tackles per game, was also rewarded with a top five finish in the Carji Greeves Medal -LRB-Geelong's Best and Fairest-RRB-. He finished the season ranked within the top ten in the league for possessions -LRB-613-RRB-, disposals per game -LRB-25.5-RRB-, and handpasses -LRB-327-RRB-. His total of 63�free kicks earned during the season was also the highest recorded since the AFL began in 1990, breaking the previous record of 54 set by Luke Darcy five years earlier. With his rookie contract due to expire, concern mounted during the year over Geelong's ability to retain Selwood beyond the season. With almost half of their premiership--winning team out of contract, Geelong could only offer contracts paying significantly less than other clubs. However, Selwood signed a new two--year deal with the club, citing ``club success and future opportunities'' as his reasons for accepting the reduced salary. -LSB-edit-RSB- 2009: Premiership pedigree Before the 2009 AFL season, Selwood was appointed to the club's seven-man leadership group at just 20�years of age. After the 2008 Grand Final loss ended Geelong's previous season, Selwood and his teammates began their 2009 campaign by capturing the pre-season NAB Cup for the second time in four years. Selwood's 33�disposals, 11�clearances, and 2�goals earned him the Michael Tuck Medal as the player adjudged best afield in this final. In round five, Selwood made his 50th senior appearance, setting a new VFL/AFL record for the highest percentage of wins inside 50�games. His involvement in 46�victories set a winning percentage of 92 percent. In addition, Selwood's 50th appearance coincided with the club's own record-setting effort for the most successful 50�game stretch in VFL/AFL history. Geelong had won 47 out of 50�games--Selwood had been involved in 46--eclipsing Essendon's return of 46�wins and 4�losses during their dominant stretch during the 1999--2001 seasons. During the round seventeen Grand Final rematch against Hawthorn, Selwood achieved career highs of 42�disposals, 10�marks, and 11�tackles. Geelong midfielder Cameron Ling described Selwood's performance as: ``Absolutely amazing... He just single-handedly lifted the whole group with his intensity around the ball. It's surprising that he's only in his third year. Selwood helped Geelong compile an 18-4 win-loss record during the season to become the first team in league history to produce three consecutive home and away campaigns with 18 or more wins. Geelong qualified for the finals series in second position on the ladder, before reaching the preliminary final for the third consecutive season. Selwood matched a career--high in finals games with 29�disposals and 9�marks during the Cats 73�point win over Collingwood, leading the club to their third successive Grand Final appearance. During the final against St Kilda, Selwood addressed the playing group with a ``stirring speech'' as Geelong entered the half--time break trailing by 6�points. Teammate Andrew Mackie lauded Selwood as ``a born leader'' and credited the team's second half turnaround to Selwood's reminder to ``go back to basics and focus upon tackling''. Selwood finished the game with 24�disposals--including a team--high 12�contested possessions and equal game--high 16�handpasses--4�marks, 6�clearances, a team--high 10�first possessions, 3�tackles, and 1�goal to help the Cats record a 12�point win and secure their second premiership in three seasons. Selwood's standout year was recognised by his peers when he became the youngest-ever winner of the AFLPA Robert Rose Most Courageous Player Award, and placed fifth for the Leigh Matthews Trophy as the AFLPA Most Valuable Player. Selwood also finished sixth in the Brownlow Medal, polling 16�votes to finish second at Geelong behind eventual winner Gary Ablett. He became the first footballer to win the Bendigo Sports Star of the Year Award, adding to his season's list of accolades. After averaging 28�disposals and 5�tackles per game over the course of the season, Selwood was also awarded with All-Australian honours for the first time in his career and a second successive top five placing for the Carji Greeves Medal. Selwood finished the year ranked fourth in the league for total disposals -LRB-691-RRB-, third for total handpasses -LRB-389-RRB-, second for contested possessions -LRB-236-RRB- and eighth for hard-ball gets. For the second successive season, he also led the league for total free kicks earned -LRB-59-RRB- and finished the year ranked within the top five at Geelong in several major statistical categories. -LSB-edit-RSB- Player profile Selwood is primarily regarded as an inside midfielder, and is noted for his physical approach, his ability to find space on the ground, and for winning the ball. Leigh Matthews has complimented Selwood as ``already the best wet-weather player in the game'', a view shared by Nathan Buckley, who notes that Selwood ``plays with a physicality and intensity that is the benchmark of the competition, consistently -LRB-finding-RRB- third and fourth efforts to win the contested ball''. Two-time Most Courageous Player Award winner Jonathan Brown has also praised Selwood for his physical and courageous approach to winning the football, describing him as ``one of the blokes -LRB-all players-RRB- within the AFL love watching''. Selwood's teammates Joel Corey and Cameron Ling have also acknowledged his maturity. They regard him as one of the most physical players in the game. Selwood has stated his career intention to ``work really hard on the basics''. Despite his admitting to being ``not the fastest player, or most skillful'', his hard running, tackling and one percent plays are important elements to his overall game. Because of his aggressive style-of-play, Selwood has gathered a reputation as a ``head--over--the--ball specialist'' and for consistently putting himself in positions to win free kicks. His ability to ``buckle his knees, -LRB-get-RRB- down and pull his arm up so that the tackler's arm goes up above the neck'' is reflected in his regular standing among league leaders for total free kicks received. As of 2009, Selwood also holds the AFL record for highest career average for frees received per game -LRB-2.28-RRB-. Since his arrival at the club his leadership ability has often been praised, leading to predictions of a future post as club captain. During his first three seasons at Geelong, Selwood's all-around ability to contribute as an attacking inside or outside midfielder has been highlighted by his regular ranking among the top five at the club for total disposals, clearances, first possessions, contested possessions, uncontested possessions, tackles, inside 50s, and score assists. As of 2009, Selwood holds the highest career average for disposals per game among currently active players -LRB-24.4-RRB- and the second-highest career average for handpasses per game -LRB-12.9-RRB-. Buckley has complimented Selwood's all-around game, making note of his ''-LRB-preparedness-RRB- to pressure the opposition in defence as ferociously as he attacks''. Throughout his career, Selwood has carried an above--average disposal efficiency of 75%. Footballing experts have praised his decision-making ability when considering his overall productivity with the football. However, his lack of natural leg speed is considered one of his more notable weaknesses. -LSB-edit-RSB- Personal life Selwood is the third of four children born to Bryce and Maree Selwood. He has three brothers, all listed with AFL clubs; two older brothers, twins Adam -LRB-playing with West Coast-RRB- and Troy -LRB-Brisbane-RRB- and a younger brother, Scott -LRB-West Coast-RRB-. Maree was awarded the 2005 AFL Players Association Mother of the Year Award for her contribution to football through each of her sons. Selwood is also a descendant of the three Crapper brothers, granduncles to Maree, each of whom played VFL football in the 1930s. Since winning the National Australia Bank-sponsored AFL Rising Star Award, Selwood has been involved in several promotions for the bank, in an ambassadorial role and in several television advertisement appearances. He is also an ambassador for the AFL's junior development program, Auskick, annually acting as a mentor for the junior player deemed `Auskicker of the Year'. Along with his parents and brothers, Selwood works on behalf of the Seeing Eye Dogs Association -LRB-SEDA-RRB- organisation. Selwood and his family sponsor pups who are being trained as a seeing eye dogs--one named ``Selwood'' in his family's honour. SEDA has said that the family's widespread dispersal around Australia, with Adam and Scott in Western Australia, Troy in Queensland, and Joel remaining in Victoria, has helped to publicise the organisation's nationwide activity. Early success on the field has led to several endorsement and promotional deals with companies including Asics and Smith's. These have seen Selwood participate in promotional appearances with rugby league player Greg Inglis and several television advertisements with AFL Hall of Famer Peter Daicos. Selwood also features in a special edition Monopoly AFL premiership gameboard, occupying Bow Street. Selwood has been a life-long supporter of the Geelong Football Club, and cites the club's own Hall of Fame member Gary Ablett as a childhood idol, along with Sydney premiership captains Paul Kelly and Brett Kirk. He currently resides in Geelong West, where he lives with a pair of childhood friends. Prior to the 2009 AFL premiership season, Selwood was elected to the AFL Players Association committee as the Geelong alternate delegate representative. -LSB-edit-RSB- Statistics -LSB-edit-RSB- Honours and achievements Team Individual Other achievements Selwood added to his list of first�year honours at season's end with the Geelong Football Club Best First Year Player Award, along with a top 20 placing in the Club Champion award. -LSB-edit-RSB- AFL career -LSB-edit-RSB- 2007: Debut Selwood was drafted by the Geelong Football Club with their first selection, and was the seventh overall draft pick in the 2006 AFL Draft.

El Greco's father, Geórgios Theotokópoulos -LRB-d. 1556-RRB-, was a merchant and tax collector. Nothing is known about his mother or his first wife, a Greek woman. El Greco's older brother, Manoússos Theotokópoulos -LRB-1531 -- December 13, 1604-RRB-, was a wealthy merchant and spent the last years of his life -LRB-1603--1604-RRB- in El Greco's Toledo home. El Greco received his initial training as an icon painter of the Cretan school, the leading centre of post-Byzantine art. In addition to painting, he probably studied the classics of ancient Greece, and perhaps the Latin classics also; he left a ``working library'' of 130 books at his death, including the Bible in Greek and an annotated Vasari. Candia was a center for artistic activity where Eastern and Western cultures co-existed harmoniously, where around two hundred painters were active during the 16th century, and had organized a painters' guild, based on the Italian model. In 1563, at the age of twenty-two, El Greco was described in a document as a ``master'' -LRB-``maestro Domenigo''-RRB-, meaning he was already a master of the guild and presumably operating his own workshop. Three years later, in June 1566, as a witness to a contract, he signed his name as μαΐστρος Μένεγος Θεοτοκόπουλος σγουράφος -LRB-Master Menégos Theotokópoulos, painter-RRB-. -LSB-d-RSB- Most scholars believe that the Theotokópoulos ``family was almost certainly Greek Orthodox'', although some Catholic sources still claim him from birth. -LSB-e-RSB- Like many Orthodox emigrants to Europe, he apparently transferred to Catholicism after his arrival, and certainly practiced as a Catholic in Spain, where he described himself as a ``devout Catholic'' in his will. The extensive archival research conducted since the early 1960s by scholars, such as Nikolaos Panayotakis, Pandelis Prevelakis and Maria Constantoudaki, indicates strongly that El Greco's family and ancestors were Greek Orthodox. One of his uncles was an Orthodox priest, and his name is not mentioned in the Catholic archival baptismal records on Crete. Prevelakis goes even further, expressing his doubt that El Greco was ever a practicing Roman Catholic. -LSB-edit-RSB- Italy It was natural for the young El Greco to pursue his career in Venice, Crete having been a possession of the Republic of Venice since 1211. Though the exact year is not clear, most scholars agree that El Greco went to Venice around 1567. -LSB-f-RSB- Knowledge of El Greco's years in Italy is limited. He lived in Venice until 1570 and, according to a letter written by his much older friend, the greatest miniaturist of the age, the Croatian Giulio Clovio, was a ``disciple'' of Titian, who was by then in his eighties but still vigorous. This may mean he worked in Titian's large studio, or not. Clovio characterized El Greco as ``a rare talent in painting''. In 1570, El Greco moved to Rome, where he executed a series of works strongly marked by his Venetian apprenticeship. It is unknown how long he remained in Rome, though he may have returned to Venice -LRB-c. 1575--1576-RRB- before he left for Spain. In Rome, on the recommendation of Giulio Clovio, El Greco was received as a guest at the Palazzo Farnese, which Cardinal Alessandro Farnese had made a centre of the artistic and intellectual life of the city. There he came into contact with the intellectual elite of the city, including the Roman scholar Fulvio Orsini, whose collection would later include seven paintings by the artist -LRB-View of Mt. Sinai and a portrait of Clovio are among them-RRB-. Unlike other Cretan artists who had moved to Venice, El Greco substantially altered his style and sought to distinguish himself by inventing new and unusual interpretations of traditional religious subject matter. His works painted in Italy were influenced by the Venetian Renaissance style of the period, with agile, elongated figures reminiscent of Tintoretto and a chromatic framework that connects him to Titian. The Venetian painters also taught him to organize his multi-figured compositions in landscapes vibrant with atmospheric light. Clovio reports visiting El Greco on a summer's day while the artist was still in Rome. El Greco was sitting in a darkened room, because he found the darkness more conducive to thought than the light of the day, which disturbed his ``inner light''. As a result of his stay in Rome, his works were enriched with elements such as violent perspective vanishing points or strange attitudes struck by the figures with their repeated twisting and turning and tempestuous gestures; all elements of Mannerism. By the time El Greco arrived in Rome, Michelangelo and Raphael were dead, but their example continued to be paramount and left little room for different approaches. Although the artistic heritage of these great masters was overwhelming for young painters, El Greco was determined to make his own mark in Rome defending his personal artistic views, ideas and style. He singled out Correggio and Parmigianino for particular praise, but he did not hesitate to dismiss Michelangelo's Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel;-LSB-g-RSB- he extended an offer to Pope Pius V to paint over the whole work in accord with the new and stricter Catholic thinking. When he was later asked what he thought about Michelangelo, El Greco replied that ``he was a good man, but he did not know how to paint''. And thus we are confronted by a paradox: El Greco is said to have reacted most strongly or even condemned Michelangelo, but he had found it impossible to withstand his influence. Michelangelo's influence can be seen in later El Greco works such as the Allegory of the Holy League. By painting portraits of Michelangelo, Titian, Clovio and, presumably, Raphael in one of his works -LRB-The Purification of the Temple-RRB-, El Greco not only expressed his gratitude but advanced the claim to rival these masters. As his own commentaries indicate, El Greco viewed Titian, Michelangelo and Raphael as models to emulate. In his 17th century Chronicles, Giulio Mancini included El Greco among the painters who had initiated, in various ways, a re-evaluation of Michelangelo's teachings. Because of his unconventional artistic beliefs -LRB-such as his dismissal of Michelangelo's technique-RRB- and personality, El Greco soon acquired enemies in Rome. Architect and writer Pirro Ligorio called him a ``foolish foreigner'', and newly discovered archival material reveals a skirmish with Farnese, who obliged the young artist to leave his palace. On July 6, 1572, El Greco officially complained about this event. A few months later, on September 18, 1572, El Greco paid his dues to the Guild of Saint Luke in Rome as a miniature painter. At the end of that year, El Greco opened his own workshop and hired as assistants the painters Lattanzio Bonastri de Lucignano and Francisco Preboste. -LSB-edit-RSB- Spain -LSB-edit-RSB- Immigration to Toledo In 1577, El Greco emigrated first to Madrid, then to Toledo, where he produced his mature works. At the time, Toledo was the religious capital of Spain and a populous city-LSB-h-RSB- with ``an illustrious past, a prosperous present and an uncertain future''. In Rome, El Greco had earned the respect of some intellectuals, but was also facing the hostility of certain art critics. During the 1570s the huge monastery-palace of El Escorial was still under construction and Philip II of Spain was experiencing difficulties in finding good artists for the many large paintings required to decorate it. Titian was dead, and Tintoretto, Veronese and Anthonis Mor all refused to come to Spain. Philip had to rely on the lesser talent of Juan Fernándes de Navarrete, whose gravedad y decoro -LRB-``seriousness and decorum''-RRB- the king approved. However, he had just died in 1579; the moment should have been ideal for El Greco. Through Clovio and Orsini, El Greco met Benito Arias Montano, a Spanish humanist and agent of Philip; Pedro Chacón, a clergyman; and Luis de Castilla, son of Diego de Castilla, the dean of the Cathedral of Toledo. El Greco's friendship with Castilla would secure his first large commissions in Toledo. He arrived in Toledo by July 1577, and signed contracts for a group of paintings that was to adorn the church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo in Toledo and for the renowned El Espolio. By September 1579 he had completed nine paintings for Santo Domingo, including The Trinity and The Assumption of the Virgin. These works would establish the painter's reputation in Toledo. El Greco did not plan to settle permanently in Toledo, since his final aim was to win the favor of Philip and make his mark in his court. Indeed, he did manage to secure two important commissions from the monarch: Allegory of the Holy League and Martyrdom of St. Maurice. However, the king did not like these works and placed the St Maurice altarpiece in the chapter-house rather than the intended chapel. He gave no further commissions to El Greco. The exact reasons for the king's dissatisfaction remain unclear. Some scholars have suggested that Philip did not like the inclusion of living persons in a religious scene; some others that El Greco's works violated a basic rule of the Counter-Reformation, namely that in the image the content was paramount rather than the style. Philip took a close interest in his artistic commissions, and had very decided tastes; a long sought-after sculpted Crucifixion by Benvenuto Cellini also failed to please when it arrived, and was likewise exiled to a less prominent place. Philip's next experiment, with Federico Zuccari was even less successful. In any case, Philip's dissatisfaction ended any hopes of royal patronage El Greco may have had. -LSB-edit-RSB- Mature works and later years Lacking the favor of the king, El Greco was obliged to remain in Toledo, where he had been received in 1577 as a great painter. According to Hortensio Félix Paravicino, a 17th-century Spanish preacher and poet, ``Crete gave him life and the painter's craft, Toledo a better homeland, where through Death he began to achieve eternal life.'' In 1585, he appears to have hired an assistant, Italian painter Francisco Preboste, and to have established a workshop capable of producing altar frames and statues as well as paintings. On March 12, 1586 he obtained the commission for The Burial of the Count of Orgaz, now his best-known work. The decade 1597 to 1607 was a period of intense activity for El Greco. During these years he received several major commissions, and his workshop created pictorial and sculptural ensembles for a variety of religious institutions. Among his major commissions of this period were three altars for the Chapel of San José in Toledo -LRB-1597--1599-RRB-; three paintings -LRB-1596--1600-RRB- for the Colegio de Doña María de Aragon, an Augustinian monastery in Madrid, and the high altar, four lateral altars, and the painting St. Ildefonso for the Capilla Mayor of the Hospital de la Caridad -LRB-Hospital of Charity-RRB- at Illescas -LRB-1603--1605-RRB-. The minutes of the commission of The Virgin of the Immaculate Conception -LRB-1607--1613-RRB-, which were composed by the personnel of the municipality, describe El Greco as ``one of the greatest men in both this kingdom and outside it''. Between 1607 and 1608 El Greco was involved in a protracted legal dispute with the authorities of the Hospital of Charity at Illescas concerning payment for his work, which included painting, sculpture and architecture;-LSB-i-RSB- this and other legal disputes contributed to the economic difficulties he experienced towards the end of his life. In 1608, he received his last major commission: for the Hospital of Saint John the Baptist in Toledo. El Greco made Toledo his home. Surviving contracts mention him as the tenant from 1585 onwards of a complex consisting of three apartments and twenty-four rooms which belonged to the Marquis de Villena. It was in these apartments, which also served as his workshop, that he passed the rest of his life, painting and studying. He lived in considerable style, sometimes employing musicians to play whilst he dined. It is not confirmed whether he lived with his Spanish female companion, Jerónima de Las Cuevas, whom he probably never married. She was the mother of his only son, Jorge Manuel, born in 1578, who also became a painter, assisted his father, and continued to repeat his compositions for many years after he inherited the studio. -LSB-j-RSB- In 1604, Jorge Manuel and Alfonsa de los Morales gave birth to El Greco's grandson, Gabriel, who was baptized by Gregorio Angulo, governor of Toledo and a personal friend of the artist. During the course of the execution of a commission for the Hospital Tavera, El Greco fell seriously ill, and a month later, on April 7, 1614, he died. A few days earlier, on March 31, he had directed that his son should have the power to make his will. Two Greeks, friends of the painter, witnessed this last will and testament -LRB-El Greco never lost touch with his Greek origins-RRB-. He was buried in the Church of Santo Domingo el Antigua, aged 73. -LSB-edit-RSB- Art -LSB-edit-RSB- Technique and style The primacy of imagination and intuition over the subjective character of creation was a fundamental principle of El Greco's style. El Greco discarded classicist criteria such as measure and proportion. He believed that grace is the supreme quest of art, but the painter achieves grace only if he manages to solve the most complex problems with obvious ease. El Greco regarded color as the most important and the most ungovernable element of painting, and declared that color had primacy over form. Francisco Pacheco, a painter and theoretician who visited El Greco in 1611, wrote that the painter liked ``the colors crude and unmixed in great blots as a boastful display of his dexterity'' and that ``he believed in constant repainting and retouching in order to make the broad masses tell flat as in nature''. Art historian Max Dvořák was the first scholar to connect El Greco's art with Mannerism and Antinaturalism. Modern scholars characterize El Greco's theory as ``typically Mannerist'' and pinpoint its sources in the Neoplatonism of the Renaissance. Jonathan Brown believes that El Greco endeavored to create a sophisticated form of art; according to Nicholas Penny ``once in Spain, El Greco was able to create a style of his own -- one that disavowed most of the descriptive ambitions of painting''. In his mature works El Greco demonstrated a characteristic tendency to dramatize rather than to describe. The strong spiritual emotion transfers from painting directly to the audience. According to Pacheco, El Greco's perturbed, violent and at times seemingly careless-in-execution art was due to a studied effort to acquire a freedom of style. El Greco's preference for exceptionally tall and slender figures and elongated compositions, which served both his expressive purposes and aesthetic principles, led him to disregard the laws of nature and elongate his compositions to ever greater extents, particularly when they were destined for altarpieces. The anatomy of the human body becomes even more otherworldly in El Greco's mature works; for The Virgin of the Immaculate Conception El Greco asked to lengthen the altarpiece itself by another 1.5�feet -LRB-0.46�m-RRB- ``because in this way the form will be perfect and not reduced, which is the worst thing that can happen to a figure'''. A significant innovation of El Greco's mature works is the interweaving between form and space; a reciprocal relationship is developed between the two which completely unifies the painting surface. This interweaving would re-emerge three centuries later in the works of Cézanne and Picasso. Another characteristic of El Greco's mature style is the use of light. As Jonathan Brown notes, ``each figure seems to carry its own light within or reflects the light that emanates from an unseen source''. Fernando Marias and Agustín Bustamante García, the scholars who transcribed El Greco's handwritten notes, connect the power that the painter gives to light with the ideas underlying Christian Neo-Platonism. Modern scholarly research emphasizes the importance of Toledo for the complete development of El Greco's mature style and stresses the painter's ability to adjust his style in accordance with his surroundings. Harold Wethey asserts that ``although Greek by descent and Italian by artistic preparation, the artist became so immersed in the religious environment of Spain that he became the most vital visual representative of Spanish mysticism''. He believes that in El Greco's mature works ``the devotional intensity of mood reflects the religious spirit of Roman Catholic Spain in the period of the Counter-Reformation''. El Greco also excelled as a portraitist, able not only to record a sitter's features but also to convey their character. His portraits are fewer in number than his religious paintings, but are of equally high quality. Wethey says that ``by such simple means, the artist created a memorable characterization that places him in the highest rank as a portraitist, along with Titian and Rembrandt''. -LSB-edit-RSB- Suggested Byzantine affinities Since the beginning of the 20th century, scholars have debated whether El Greco's style had Byzantine origins. Certain art historians had asserted that El Greco's roots were firmly in the Byzantine tradition, and that his most individual characteristics derive directly from the art of his ancestors, while others had argued that Byzantine art could not be related to El Greco's later work. The discovery of the Dormition of the Virgin on Syros, an authentic and signed work from the painter's Cretan period, and the extensive archival research in the early 1960s, contributed to the rekindling and reassessment of these theories. Although following many conventions of the Byzantine icon, aspects of the style certainly show Venetian influence, and the composition, showing the death of Mary, combines the different doctrines of the Orthodox Dormition of the Virgin and the Catholic Assumption of the Virgin. Significant scholarly works of the second half of the 20th century devoted to El Greco reappraise many of the interpretations of his work, including his supposed Byzantinism. Based on the notes written in El Greco's own hand, on his unique style, and on the fact that El Greco signed his name in Greek characters, they see an organic continuity between Byzantine painting and his art. According to Marina Lambraki-Plaka ``far from the influence of Italy, in a neutral place which was intellectually similar to his birthplace, Candia, the Byzantine elements of his education emerged and played a catalytic role in the new conception of the image which is presented to us in his mature work''. In making this judgement, Lambraki-Plaka disagrees with Oxford University professors Cyril Mango and Elizabeth Jeffreys, who assert that ``despite claims to the contrary, the only Byzantine element of his famous paintings was his signature in Greek lettering''. Nikos Hadjinikolaou states that from 1570 El Greco's painting is ``neither Byzantine nor post-Byzantine but Western European. The works he produced in Italy belong to the history of the Italian art, and those he produced in Spain to the history of Spanish art''. The English art historian David Davies seeks the roots of El Greco's style in the intellectual sources of his Greek-Christian education and in the world of his recollections from the liturgical and ceremonial aspect of the Orthodox Church. Davies believes that the religious climate of the Counter-Reformation and the aesthetics of mannerism acted as catalysts to activate his individual technique. He asserts that the philosophies of Platonism and ancient Neo-Platonism, the works of Plotinus and Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, the texts of the Church fathers and the liturgy offer the keys to the understanding of El Greco's style. Summarizing the ensuing scholarly debate on this issue, José Álvarez Lopera, curator at the Museo del Prado, Madrid, concludes that the presence of ``Byzantine memories'' is obvious in El Greco's mature works, though there are still some obscure issues concerning his Byzantine origins needing further illumination. -LSB-edit-RSB- Architecture and sculpture El Greco was highly esteemed as an architect and sculptor during his lifetime. He usually designed complete altar compositions, working as architect and sculptor as well as painter -- at, for instance, the Hospital de la Caridad. There he decorated the chapel of the hospital, but the wooden altar and the sculptures he created have in all probability perished. For El Espolio the master designed the original altar of gilded wood which has been destroyed, but his small sculptured group of the Miracle of St. Ildefonso still survives on the lower centre of the frame. His most important architectural achievement was the church and Monastery of Santo Domingo el Antiguo, for which he also executed sculptures and paintings. El Greco is regarded as a painter who incorporated architecture in his painting. He is also credited with the architectural frames to his own paintings in Toledo. Pacheco characterized him as ``a writer of painting, sculpture and architecture''. In the marginalia that El Greco inscribed in his copy of Daniele Barbaro's translation of Vitruvius' De architectura, he refuted Vitruvius' attachment to archaeological remains, canonical proportions, perspective and mathematics. He also saw Vitruvius' manner of distorting proportions in order to compensate for distance from the eye as responsible for creating monstrous forms. El Greco was averse to the very idea of rules in architecture; he believed above all in the freedom of invention and defended novelty, variety, and complexity. These ideas were, however, far too extreme for the architectural circles of his era and had no immediate resonance. -LSB-edit-RSB- Legacy -LSB-edit-RSB- Posthumous critical reputation El Greco was disdained by the immediate generations after his death because his work was opposed in many respects to the principles of the early baroque style which came to the fore near the beginning of the 17th century and soon supplanted the last surviving traits of the 16th-century Mannerism. El Greco was deemed incomprehensible and had no important followers. Only his son and a few unknown painters produced weak copies of his works. Late 17th- and early 18th-century Spanish commentators praised his skill but criticized his antinaturalistic style and his complex iconography. Some of these commentators, such as Acislo Antonio Palomino de Castro y Velasco and Juan Agustín Ceán Bermúdez, described his mature work as ``contemptible'', ``ridiculous'' and ``worthy of scorn''. The views of Palomino and Bermúdez were frequently repeated in Spanish historiography, adorned with terms such as ``strange'', ``queer'', ``original'', ``eccentric'' and ``odd''. The phrase ``sunk in eccentricity'', often encountered in such texts, in time developed into ``madness''. -LSB-j-RSB- With the arrival of Romantic sentiments in the late 18th century, El Greco's works were examined anew. To French writer Théophile Gautier, El Greco was the precursor of the European Romantic movement in all its craving for the strange and the extreme. Gautier regarded El Greco as the ideal romantic hero -LRB-the ``gifted'', the ``misunderstood'', the ``mad''-RRB-,-LSB-k-RSB- and was the first who explicitly expressed his admiration for El Greco's later technique. French art critics Zacharie Astruc and Paul Lefort helped to promote a widespread revival of interest in his painting. In the 1890s, Spanish painters living in Paris adopted him as their guide and mentor. However, in the popular English-speaking imagination he remained the man who ``painted horrors in the Escorial'' in the words of Ephraim Chambers' Cyclopaedia in 1899. In 1908, Spanish art historian Manuel Bartolomé Cossío published the first comprehensive catalogue of El Greco's works; in this book El Greco was presented as the founder of the Spanish School. The same year Julius Meier-Graefe, a scholar of French Impressionism, travelled in Spain, expecting to study Velásquez, but instead becoming fascinated by El Greco; he recorded his experiences in Spanische Reise -LRB-Spanish Journey, published in English in 1926-RRB-, the book which widely established El Greco as a great painter of the past ``outside a somewhat narrow circle''. In El Greco's work, Meier-Graefe found foreshadowing of modernity. These are the words Meier-Graefe used to describe El Greco's impact on the artistic movements of his time: To the English artist and critic Roger Fry in 1920, El Greco was the archetypal genius who did as he thought best ``with complete indifference to what effect the right expression might have on the public''. Fry described El Greco as ``an old master who is not merely modern, but actually appears a good many steps ahead of us, turning back to show us the way''. During the same period, other researchers developed alternate, more radical theories. The physicians August Goldschmidt and Germán Beritens argued that El Greco painted such elongated human figures because he had vision problems -LRB-possibly progressive astigmatism or strabismus-RRB- that made him see bodies longer than they were, and at an angle to the perpendicular;-LSB-l-RSB- the physician Arturo Perera, however, attributed this style to the use of marijuana. Michael Kimmelman, a reviewer for The New York Times, stated that ``to Greeks -LSB-El Greco-RSB- became the quintessential Greek painter; to the Spanish, the quintessential Spaniard''. As was proved by the campaign of the National Art Gallery in Athens to raise the funds for the purchase of Saint Peter in 1995, El Greco is loved not just by experts and art lovers but also by ordinary people; thanks to the donations mainly of individuals and public benefit foundations the National Art Gallery raised 1.2 million dollars and purchased the painting. Epitomizing the consensus of El Greco's impact, Jimmy Carter, the 39th President of the United States, said in April 1980 that El Greco was ``the most extraordinary painter that ever came along back then'' and that he was ``maybe three or four centuries ahead of his time''. -LSB-edit-RSB- Influence on other artists El Greco's re-evaluation was not limited to scholars. According to Efi Foundoulaki, ``painters and theoreticians from the beginning of the 20th century `discovered' a new El Greco but in process they also discovered and revealed their own selves''. His expressiveness and colors influenced Eugène Delacroix and Édouard Manet. To the Blaue Reiter group in Munich in 1912, El Greco typified that mystical inner construction that it was the task of their generation to rediscover. The first painter who appears to have noticed the structural code in the morphology of the mature El Greco was Paul Cézanne, one of the forerunners of cubism. Comparative morphological analyses of the two painters revealed their common elements, such as the distortion of the human body, the reddish and -LRB-in appearance only-RRB- unworked backgrounds and the similarities in the rendering of space. According to Brown, ``Cézanne and El Greco are spiritual brothers despite the centuries which separate them''. Fry observed that Cézanne drew from ``his great discovery of the permeation of every part of the design with a uniform and continuous plastic theme''. The Symbolists, and Pablo Picasso during his Blue Period, drew on the cold tonality of El Greco, utilizing the anatomy of his ascetic figures. While Picasso was working on Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, he visited his friend Ignacio Zuloaga in his studio in Paris and studied El Greco's Opening of the Fifth Seal -LRB-owned by Zuloaga since 1897-RRB-. The relation between Les Demoiselles d'Avignon and the Opening of the Fifth Seal was pinpointed in the early 1980s, when the stylistic similarities and the relationship between the motifs of both works were analysed. The early cubist explorations of Picasso were to uncover other aspects in the work of El Greco: structural analysis of his compositions, multi-faced refraction of form, interweaving of form and space, and special effects of highlights. Several traits of cubism, such as distortions and the materialistic rendering of time, have their analogies in El Greco's work. According to Picasso, El Greco's structure is cubist. On February 22, 1950, Picasso began his series of ``paraphrases'' of other painters' works with The Portrait of a Painter after El Greco. Foundoulaki asserts that Picasso ``completed ... the process for the activation of the painterly values of El Greco which had been started by Manet and carried on by Cézanne''. The expressionists focused on the expressive distortions of El Greco. According to Franz Marc, one of the principal painters of the German expressionist movement, ``we refer with pleasure and with steadfastness to the case of El Greco, because the glory of this painter is closely tied to the evolution of our new perceptions on art''. Jackson Pollock, a major force in the abstract expressionist movement, was also influenced by El Greco. By 1943, Pollock had completed sixty drawing compositions after El Greco and owned three books on the Cretan master. Contemporary painters are also inspired by El Greco's art. Kysa Johnson used El Greco's paintings of the Immaculate Conception as the compositional framework for some of her works, and the master's anatomical distortions are somewhat reflected in Fritz Chesnut's portraits. El Greco's personality and work were a source of inspiration for poet Rainer Maria Rilke. One set of Rilke's poems -LRB-Himmelfahrt Mariae I.II., 1913-RRB- was based directly on El Greco's Immaculate Conception. Greek writer Nikos Kazantzakis, who felt a great spiritual affinity for El Greco, called his autobiography Report to Greco and wrote a tribute to the Cretan-born artist. In 1998, the Greek electronic composer and artist Vangelis published El Greco, a symphonic album inspired by the artist. This album is an expansion of an earlier album by Vangelis, Foros Timis Ston Greco -LRB-A Tribute to El Greco, Φόρος Τιμής Στον Γκρέκο-RRB-. The life of the Cretan-born artist is the subject of the recent film El Greco of Greek, Spanish and British production. Directed by Ioannis Smaragdis, the film began shooting in October 2006 on the island of Crete and debuted on the screen one year later; British actor Nick Ashdon has been cast to play El Greco. -LSB-edit-RSB- Debates on attribution The exact number of El Greco's works has been a hotly contested issue. In 1937, a highly influential study by art historian Rodolfo Pallucchini had the effect of greatly increasing the number of works accepted to be by El Greco. Pallucchini attributed to El Greco a small triptych in the Galleria Estense at Modena on the basis of a signature on the painting on the back of the central panel on the Modena triptych -LRB-``Χείρ Δομήνιχου'', Created by the hand of Doménikos-RRB-. There was consensus that the triptych was indeed an early work of El Greco and, therefore, Pallucchini's publication became the yardstick for attributions to the artist. Nevertheless, Wethey denied that the Modena triptych had any connection at all with the artist and, in 1962, produced a reactive catalogue raisonné with a greatly reduced corpus of materials. Whereas art historian José Camón Aznar had attributed between 787 and 829 paintings to the Cretan master, Wethey reduced the number to 285 authentic works and Halldor Sœhner, a German researcher of Spanish art, recognized only 137. Wethey and other scholars rejected the notion that Crete took any part in his formation and supported the elimination of a series of works from El Greco's oeuvre. Since 1962, the discovery of the Dormition and the extensive archival research has gradually convinced scholars that Wethey's assessments were not entirely correct, and that his catalogue decisions may have distorted the perception of the whole nature of El Greco's origins, development and oeuvre. The discovery of the Dormition led to the attribution of three other signed works of ``Doménicos'' to El Greco -LRB-Modena Triptych, St. Luke Painting the Virgin and Child, and The Adoration of the Magi-RRB- and then to the acceptance of more works as authentic -- some signed, some not -LRB-such as The Passion of Christ -LRB-Pietà with Angels-RRB- painted in 1566-RRB-, -- which were brought into the group of early works of El Greco. El Greco is now seen as an artist with a formative training on Crete; a series of works illuminate the style of early El Greco, some painted while he was still in Crete, some from his period in Venice, and some from his subsequent stay in Rome. Even Wethey accepted that ``he -LSB-El Greco-RSB- probably had painted the little and much disputed triptych in the Galleria Estense at Modena before he left Crete''. Nevertheless, disputes over the exact number of El Greco's authentic works remain unresolved, and the status of Wethey's catalogue raisonné is at the centre of these disagreements. A few sculptures, including Epimetheus and Pandora, have been attributed to El Greco. This doubtful attribution is based on the testimony of Pacheco -LRB-he saw in El Greco's studio a series of figurines, but these may have been merely models-RRB-. There are also four drawings among the surviving works of El Greco; three of them are preparatory works for the altarpiece of Santo Domingo el Antiguo and the fourth is a study for one of his paintings, The Crucifixion. During the course of the execution of a commission for the Hospital Tavera, El Greco fell seriously ill, and a month later, on April 7, 1614, he died. In 1570, El Greco moved to Rome, where he executed a series of works strongly marked by his Venetian apprenticeship. His works painted in Italy were influenced by the Venetian Renaissance style of the period, with agile, elongated figures reminiscent of Tintoretto and a chromatic framework that connects him to Titian. -LSB-edit-RSB- Spain -LSB-edit-RSB- Immigration to Toledo In 1577, El Greco emigrated first to Madrid, then to Toledo, where he produced his mature works.

During the 18th century, madness was ``both held to reveal inner truth and condemned to silence and exclusion as something unintelligible by reason, and therefore threatening to society and to humanity''. It was commonly held to be an incurable affliction whose sufferers should be isolated from society. Physician William Battie--who later treated Smart--wrote: In particular, Battie defined madness as ``deluded imagination''. However, he was attacked by other physicians, such as John Monro, who worked at Bethlem Hospital. In his Remarks on Dr. Battie's Treatise on Madness, Monro explained that those who were mad had the correct perceptions, but that they lacked the ability to judge properly. Although Monro promoted ideas of reform, his suggested treatment--beating patients--was as harsh on patients as Battie's preferred option, of completely isolating patients from society. In 1758, Battie and others argued that those deemed ``mad'' were abused under the British asylum system, and they pushed for parliamentary action. Battie's Treatise on Madness emphasised the problems of treating the hospitals as tourist attractions and the punitive measures taken against patients. The arguments of Battie and others resulted in the passage of the Act for Regulating Private Madhouses -LRB-1774-RRB-, but were too late to help Smart. Modern critics, however, have a more cynical view of the 18th-century use of the term ``madness'' when diagnosing patients; psychiatrist Thomas Szasz viewed the idea of madness as arbitrary and unnatural. Agreeing with Szasz's position, philosopher Michel Foucault emphasised that asylums were used in the 18th century to attack dissenting views and that the idea of madness was a cultural fear held by the British public, rather than a legitimate medical condition. In particular, Foucault considered the 18th century a time of ``great confinement''. This description is consistent with Smart's 1760s writings on the subject in which, according to Thomas Keymer, ``the category of madness is insistently relativized, and made to seem little more than the invention of a society strategically concerned to discredit all utterances or conduct that threatens its interests and norms.'' 18th century treatment of inpatients was simple: they were to be fed daily a light diet of bread, oatmeal, some meat or cheese, and a little amount of beer, which were inadequate in meeting daily nutritional needs; they were denied contact without outsiders, including family members; and they would be denied access to that which was deemed to be the cause of their madness -LRB-these causes ranged from alcohol and food to working outside-RRB-. If their actions appeared ``afresh and without assignable cause'', then their condition would be labelled as ``original'' madness and deemed incurable. An institution like St Luke's, run by Battie, held both ``curable'' and ``incurable'' patients. There were few spots available for patients to receive free treatment, and many were released after a year to make room for new admittances. -LSB-edit-RSB- Asylum During the 1740s, Smart published many poems while a student at Pembroke College, Cambridge. He eventually left the school in 1749 in order to devote his time to poetry. In 1750, Smart started to familiarize himself with Grub Street, London's writing district, and met John Newbery, a publisher. Soon after, Newbery began publishing Smart's works in various magazines and in collections, including Poems on Several Occasions -LRB-1752-RRB-. Of these works, Smart was known for his Seatonian Prize-winning poems, his pastoral poem The Hop-Garden, and his mock epic The Hilliad. In 1752, Smart married Newbery's daughter, Anna Maria Carnan, and had two daughters with her by 1754. Although many of Smart's works were published between 1753 and 1755, he had little money to provide for his family. At the end of 1755, he finished a translation of the works of Horace, but even that provided little income. Having no other choices, Smart signed a 99-year long contract in November 1755 to produce a weekly paper entitled The Universal Visiter or Monthly Memorialist, and the strain of writing caused Smart's health to deteriorate. On 5 June 1756, Smart's father-in-law Newbery published, without permission, Smart's Hymn to the Supreme Being, a poem which thanked God for recovery from an illness of some kind, possibly a ``disturbed mental state''. During the illness, Smart was possibly confined to Newbery's home and unable to write or be socially active. Out of sympathy for Smart, many of his friends, including writer and critic Samuel Johnson, began to write in the Universal Visiter to fulfill Smart's contractual obligation to produce content for the magazine. The publication of Hymn to the Supreme Being marked the beginning of Smart's obsession with religion and eventual confinement for madness because he began praying ``without ceasing''. Smart's behaviour was probably influenced by St Paul's command in the First Epistle to the Thessalonians to ``Pray without ceasing'' and William Law's The Spirit of Prayer, which argues that a constant state of prayer will establish a connection with God. Smart began by praying at regular intervals but this slowly deteriorated into irregular praying in which he would interrupt his friends' activities and call them into the street to pray with him. These calls for public prayer continued until an incident that Smart later described in Jubilate Agno: ``For I blessed God in St James's Park till I routed all the company... For the officers of the peace are at variance with me, and the watchman smites me with his staff'' -LRB-Jubilate Agno B 90--91-RRB-. Christopher Hunter, Smart's biographer and nephew, described the situation: Hunter reports that Samuel Johnson visited Smart during the latter's confinement, and it was Johnson that, ``on the first approaches of Mr Smart's malady, wrote several papers for a periodical publication in which that gentleman was concerned.'' However, at no time did Smart ever believe himself to be insane; these meetings began before Smart was ever put into asylum because he still contributed, although not as significantly, to the Universal Visiter. In joking about writing for the Universal Visiter, Johnson claimed: ``for poor Smart, while he was mad, not then knowing the terms on which he was engaged to write�... I hoped his wits would return to him. Mine returned to me, and I wrote in `the Universal Visitor' no longer.'' There are other possibilities beyond madness or religious fervor that may have led to Smart's confinement: Newbery may have used the imprisonment of his son-in-law as leverage to control the publication of Smart's work and as a warning to others who worked for him not to cross him. Another theory suggests Smart's actions were a result of alcohol, and had nothing to do with a mental imbalance. However, Smart may have been imprisoned for embarrassing his father-in-law in some way, which could have resulted from an incident in which Smart drank. Hester Thrale reinforced this latter possibility when she claimed that Smart's ``religious fervor'' tended to coincide with times that Smart was intoxicated. Smart's own testimony that he ``blessed God in St. James's Park till I routed all the company'' -LRB-Jubilate Agno B 90--91-RRB- as representing his religious madness is equally dismissed as resulting from drinking, as he was known for pulling pranks and the Board of the Green Cloth, the government body that controlled St James's Park, would treat most disturbances in the park as resulting from madness. If Smart was placed into the asylum as a result of actions at St James's, he would not have been the only one, since records show that the Board of the Green Cloth was responsible for admitting sixteen people to Bethlem Hospital for ``frenzy'' at St James's Park during the century prior to Smart being placed in St Luke's. The specific events of Smart's confinement are unknown. He may have been in a private madhouse before St Luke's and later moved from St Luke's to Mr Potter's asylum until his release. At St Luke's, he transitioned from being ``curable'' to ``incurable'', and was moved to Mr Potter's asylum for monetary reasons. During Smart's confinement time, his wife Anna left and took the children with her to Ireland. There is no record that he ever saw her again. His isolation led him into writing religious poetry, and he abandoned the traditional genres of the 18th century that marked his earlier poetry when he wrote Jubilate Agno. During his time in asylum, Smart busied himself with a daily ritual of writing poetry; these lyric fragments eventually formed his Jubilate Agno and A Song to David. Smart might have turned to writing poetry as a way to focus the mind or as self-therapy. Although 20th-century critics debate whether his new poetic self-examination represents an expression of evangelical Christianity, his poetry during his isolation does show a desire for ``unmediated revelation'' from God. There is an ``inner light'' that serves as a focal point for Smart and his poems written during his confinement, and that inner light connects him to the Christian God. -LSB-edit-RSB- St Luke's Hospital for Lunatics Few details are known about Smart's time at St Luke's Hospital for Lunatics. He was admitted to St Luke's on 6 May 1757 as a ``Curable Patient''. It is possible that Smart was confined at Newbery's behest over old debts and a poor relationship that existed between the two; Newbery had previously mocked Smart's immorality in A Collection of Pretty Poems for the Amusement of Children six Foot High. Regardless of Newbery's exact reasons, there is evidence suggesting that Newbery's admittance of Smart into the mental asylum was not based on madness. In order to have Smart admitted, Newbery probably provided a small bribe, although bribes were against St Luke's policy. There is little information about Smart's condition during his stay at St Luke's, possibly because Battie's denied his patients from being visited, including by their own family members. One of the few records that survive of Smart's time at St Luke's was an entry in St Luke's Minute Book, which read: During Smart's confinement at St Luke's, not even other doctors were allowed to see Smart unless they had received personal permission from Battie. It was improbable that Smart could have left the asylum without being released by Battie. Even if Smart would have attempted to obtain release via legal means, the rules for subpoenaing release would have been almost impossible to follow based on the system that Battie had in place, which isolated the individual from all contact. Eventually, Smart was deemed ``incurable'' and would not have been released by the hospital but for its lack of funds. -LSB-edit-RSB- Mr Potter's madhouse After being released from St Luke's, Smart was taken to a private madhouse. Elizabeth LeNoir, Smart's daughter, was brought to see her father and stated that he was ``committed by Mr Newbery to the care of a Mr Potter who kept a private house at Bethnal Green''. She described her experience as being held in a ``small neat parlour''. However, Mr Potter's private madhouse was not ``homely'', and Smart's treatments were far worse, as he describes: ``For they work on me with their harping-irons, which is a barbarous instrument, because I am more unguarded than others'' -LRB-Jubilate Agno B 129-RRB-. Smart was left alone for four years, except for his cat Jeoffry and the occasional gawker who would come to see those deemed mad. Piozzi described Smart's general situation: ``He was both a wit and a scholar, and visited as such while under confinement for MADNESS.'' It is very possible that he felt ``homeless'' during his confinement and surely felt that he was in a ``limbo... between public and private space'' from being watched by outsiders. In London, only a few of his works were still being published, but the proceeds were taken by Newbery. However, Smart did get to see published a collection of his work under the pseudonym ``Mrs Midnight'' titled Mrs. Midnight's Orations; and other Select Pieces: as they were spoken at the Oratory in the Hay-Market, London. Smart did not profit from the work, but he was able to see at least some of his previous work being printed again. Smart, according to his 20th-century biographer Arthur Sherbo, had only ``his God and his poetry''. A few of his loyal friends eventually grew tired of the treatment Smart received and freed him from Mr Potter's. -LSB-edit-RSB- Release There is little information about how and why Smart was released from asylum, but his daughter claimed: ``He grew better, and some misjudging friends who misconstrued Mr Newbery's great kindness in placing him under necessary & salutary restriction which might possibly have eventually wrought a cure, invited him to dinner and he returned to his confinement no more.'' What is known about the actual events is that John Sherratt, Christopher Smart's friend, believed that Smart's confinement was unfair and wanted to negotiate Smart's release. In January 1763, he met with a parliamentary committee to discuss the issue of individuals falsely imprisoned and abuses that they would receive in asylums. In particular, Sherratt argued that many were admitted for habitual intoxication, which undermined Battie's and other asylum keeper's reputations. A finding by the parliamentary committee released 27 January 1763 bolstered Sherratt's chances to release Smart. To those around him, Smart appeared perfectly sane, and he was most likely released because of legislation concurrently being passed in parliament advocating for a reform to patient care. Smart left the asylum on 30 January 1763 with Sherratt. Upon leaving asylum, Smart took the manuscripts of A Song to David, many translations of Psalms, and Jubilate Agno. A Song to David was published on 6 April 1763. Harsh reviews followed which mocked Smart's time in the asylum instead of dealing with the poems. Jubilate Agno stayed in manuscript form and passed into the hands of the friends of William Cowper, a poet also placed into asylum and Smart's contemporary, when they investigated the concept of ``madness''. The work stayed in private holdings until it was rediscovered in the 20th century by William Stead. It was not published until 1939 when it was printed with the title Rejoice in the Lamb: A Song from Bedlam. -LSB-edit-RSB- Analysis Samuel Johnson's biographer James Boswell described a moment when Charles Burney inquired of his friend Johnson of Smart's state. Johnson used the term ``madness'' to comment on the state of society before explaining to Burney that Smart's actions that were deemed symptoms of madness were actually reasonable: In an article printed in the Gentleman's Magazine, Hester Piozzi, Smart's acquaintance and Johnson's close friend, argued that in many aspects Smart appears sane: Beyond Smart's circle of friends, few were willing to dismiss claims that Smart was affected by madness. Most contemporary literary critics knew of Smart's time in asylum and, upon publication of his A Song to David, called attention to aspects of the poem which they could use to claim that Smart was still ``mad''. The view was widely held, and the poet William Mason wrote to Thomas Gray, ``I have seen his Song to David & from thence conclude him as mad as ever.'' -LSB-edit-RSB- 19th century It was a century before a positive twist was put on Christopher Smart's time in asylum; the Victorian poet Robert Browning argued that A Song to David was great because Smart was mad at the time. In his poem Parleyings -LRB-1887-RRB-, Browning claimed: To Browning, Smart's temporary madness was what allowed A Song to David to compose poetry similar to that of John Milton and John Keats. Christopher Smart, as Browning's poem continued, Browning's remarks brought about a later appreciation of A Song to David and Smart's madness. A review of Browning's Parleying claimed that Christopher Smart was ``possessed by his subject... and where there is true possession -- where the fires of the poet's imagination are not choked by self-consciousness or by too much fuel from the intellect -- idiosyncracy, mannerism, and even conventional formulae are for the time `burnt and purged away'.'' The 19th-century poet Dante Gabriel Rossetti emphasised the benefits of Smart's madness and claimed that A Song to David was ``the only great accomplished poem of the last century.'' Two years later, Francis Palgrave continued the theme when he wrote that the Song exhibited ``noble wildness and transitions from grandeur to tenderness, from Earth to Heaven'' and that it was ``unique in our Poetry.'' Seven years after Palgrave, critic John Churton Collins agreed with Rosetti and Palgrave, but to a lesser extent, when he wrote, ``This poem stands alone, the most extraordinary phenomenon, perhaps, in our literature, the one rapt strain in the poetry of the eighteenth century, the work of a poet who, though he produced much, has not produced elsewhere a single line which indicates the power here displayed.'' -LSB-edit-RSB- 20th century and contemporary The 20th-century view among critics favoured that Smart suffered from some kind of mental distress when writing his poems. A review by ``Mathews'' titled ``Thin Partitions'', in the 30 March 1901 The Academy, claimed that: In 1933, A. E. Housman sided with Browning's and Mathew's interpretation and connected Smart's madness with poetic genius in his lecture The Name and Nature of Poetry: ``As matters actually stand, who are the English poets of that age in whom pre-eminently one can hear and recognize the true poetic accent emerging clearly from the contemporary dialect? These four: Collins, Christopher Smart, Cowper, and Blake. And what other characteristic had these four in common? In 1994, Branimir Rieger differed from Housman's view by distancing Smart from the others when he argued that ``Collins and Cowper pine as isolated individuals, guiltily aware of a vitality that is not finally human but divine. Smart soars beyond individuality to embrace that vitality, but at a cost of all human relationship.'' However, there are many that disagreed that Smart suffered from madness; Edward Ainsworth and Charles Noyes, when discussing Smart's Hymn to the Supreme Being, said, ``The mind that composed this hymn was not deranged. Yet in the poem one sees the morbidly religious mind which, in disorder, was to produce the Jubilate Agno, and, with order restored, the Song to David. Additionally, they claimed that Smart's Nevertheless, Ainsworth and Noyes were not completely skeptical about Smart's diagnosis when they continued: ``But when the desire to pray struck him, Smart abandoned what the world chose to call rationality.'' In 1960, psychiatrist Russel Brain diagnosed Smart as suffering from cyclothymia or manic depression. Brain based his diagnosis on Smart's own claims about how he felt, and he concluded that ``in Smart's case the mental illness was not the result of his drunkenness, but he drank because he was mentally unstable.'' Arthur Sherbo, in 1967, argued that ``The nature of Smart's madness is impossible to diagnose at this distance in time'' and then argued that: The possible religious component of Smart's condition was taken up by 20th-century critics as an explanation for why the 18th century saw Smart as mad. Laurence Binyon, in 1934, believed that religion played a major role in how society viewed Smart: ``Smart's madness seems to have taken the form of a literal interpretation of the injunction Pray without ceasing. He embarrassed visitors by insisting on their joining him in his supplications -LSB-...-RSB- Obsession with a fixed idea is a common form of insanity. But such obsessions are a mental imprisonment; whereas the Song is unmistakably the expression of a great release.'' Binyon's idea was picked up by Sophia Blaydes, in 1966, who pointed out that society was prejudiced against those who experienced enthusiasm, a strong spiritual connection to God. It was against religious prejudice that she argued, In the 18th century, as Blaydes continued, the word changed from possessed by god to inspired to falsely inspired. The result of this change was that British society viewed enthusiasm as the enemy to both reason and social order. Thus, ``Smart, the hack-writer, would not have been greeted by a hostile audience, but Smart, the enthusiast, would have been condemned immediately. The result would be obvious: his past work, previously lauded, would be ignored, and his future work would receive immediate condemnation. such was the history of Smart's contemporary reputation.'' In determining if Smart was really mad or not, Blaydes concluded, ``in Smart's day, any sign of enthusiasm would have been cause for the judgment of madness -LSB-...-RSB- Two accounts of Smart and the nature of his madness have been preserved for us. Each permits some doubt that the poet was mad and could be regarded so in any age.'' Frances Anderson, in 1974 characterized Smart's ``illness'' as insanity and obsession, but believed that ``Smart's madness consisted of his efforts to obey literally St Paul's injunction to the Thessalonians: `Pray without ceasing.''' During his episodes of illness, as Anderson continued, Smart ``probably suffered some periods of delirium'' but also ``appeared to know what he was doing''. Smart's actions were similar to 18th-century Methodists that were ``addicted to public prayer with what was thought to be overly charged high spirits. Such displayers of religious emotionalism were often confined not only to private madhouses, but also to Bedlam''. Later in 1998, Charles Rosen pointed out that ``The Enlightenment condemned religious enthusiasm as appropriate for the uneducated and the great unwashed'' and ``it is understandable that the only original and vital religious poetry between 1760 and 1840 should have been written by poets considered genuinely mad by their contemporaries: Smart, Blake, and Hölderlin.'' Accounts at the end of the 20th century focused on the effects of Smart's confinement. Clement Hawes, following Michel Foucault's interpretation of the 18th century that there was an ''`animality' of madness'', believed that Smart emotionally connected with animals because of the ``medical stigmatization'' he felt at the hands of his fellow man. Chris Mounsey, agreeing with Hawes's interpretation, believed that Smart's treatment was ``a bestializing process and had taught him to hold his tongue and sit out his time as quietly as possible.'' Contrary to the bestialization, Allan Ingram argued that Jubilate Agno was ``a poetic phenomenon that would have demolished contemporary poetic orthodoxies had it been publishable. The mad individual presented a gross distortion of the human form that nevertheless insisted on remaining human, but mad language could be even more disturbing.'' His isolation led him into writing religious poetry, and he abandoned the traditional genres of the 18th century that marked his earlier poetry when he wrote Jubilate Agno. Johnson used the term ``madness'' to comment on the state of society before explaining to Burney that Smart's actions that were deemed symptoms of madness were actually reasonable: In an article printed in the Gentleman's Magazine, Hester Piozzi, Smart's acquaintance and Johnson's close friend, argued that in many aspects Smart appears sane: Beyond Smart's circle of friends, few were willing to dismiss claims that Smart was affected by madness.

The remainder of the Belgian coast came under the occupation of German Marine Divisions, including the important strategic ports of Antwerp and Bruges. Whilst Antwerp was a deep water port vulnerable to British attack from the sea, Bruges, sitting six miles -LRB-10 km-RRB- inland, was comparatively safe from naval bombardment or coastal raids. A network of canals connected Bruges with the coast at Ostend and Zeebrugge, through which small warships such as destroyers, light cruisers and submarines could travel and find a safe harbour from which to launch raids into the English Channel and along the coasts of South-East England. U-boats could also depart from Bruges at night, cutting a day off the journey to the Western Approaches, more easily avoiding the North Sea Mine Barrage and allowing U-boat captains to gain familiarity with the net and mine defences of the English Channel, through which they had to pass to reach the main battlegrounds of the Atlantic. During 1915 and 1916, the German Navy had developed Bruges from a small Flanders port into a major naval centre with large concrete bunkers for U-boats to shelter from nightly bombing raids, extensive barracks and training facilities for U-boat crews, and similar facilities for other classes of raiding warship. Bruges was therefore a vital asset in the German Navy's increasingly desperate struggle to prevent Britain from receiving food and matériel from the rest of the world. The significance of Bruges was not lost on British naval planners and two previous attempts to close the exit at Ostend, the smaller and narrower of the Bruges canals, had ended in failure. On 7 September 1915, four monitors of the Lord Clive class of the Dover Patrol had bombarded the dockyard, while German coastal artillery returned fire. Only 14 rounds were fired by the British with the result that only part of the dockyard was set on fire. In a bombardment on 22 September 1917 the lock gates were hit causing the basin to drain at low water. Two years passed before the next attempt on the Ostend locks. The First Ostend Raid was conducted in tandem with the similar Zeebrugge Raid led by Admiral Roger Keyes on 23 April 1918; a large scale operation to block the wider canal at Zeebrugge. Both attacks largely failed, but whilst at Zeebrugge the operation came so close to success that it took several months for the British authorities to realise that it had been unsuccessful, at Ostend the attack had ended catastrophically. Both blockships intended to close off the canal had grounded over half a mile from their intended location and been scuttled by their crews under heavy artillery and long-range small arms fire, which caused severe casualties. Thus whilst Zeebrugge seemed to be blocked entirely, Ostend was open wide, nullifying any success which might have been achieved at the other port. -LSB-edit-RSB- Planning As British forces on the South-East Coast regrouped, remanned and repaired following heavy losses at Zeebrugge, Keyes planned a return to Ostend with the intention of closing the canal and consequently severing Bruges from the sea, closing the harbour and trapping the 18 U-boats and 25 destroyers present for months to come. Volunteers from amongst the force which had failed in April aided the planning with advice based on bitter experience. Amongst these volunteers were Lieutenant-Commander Henry Hardy of HMS Sirius, Commander Alfred Godsal, former captain of HMS Brilliant, and Brilliant's first lieutenant Victor Crutchley. These officers approached Commodore Hubert Lynes and Admiral Roger Keyes with a refined plan for a second attempt to block the port. Other officers came forward to participate as well and Keyes and Lynes devised an operational plan to attack the canal mouth at Ostend once more. Two obsolete cruisers, the aged HMS Sappho and the battered veteran of Zeebrugge HMS Vindictive were fitted out for the operation by having their non-essential equipment stripped out, their essential equipment reinforced and picked crews selected from volunteers. The ships' forward ballast tanks were filled with concrete to both protect their bows during the attack, and act as a greater and more lasting obstacle once sunk. Vindictive was commanded by Godsal; her six officers and 48 crew were all volunteer veterans of the previous failed attempt by HMS Brilliant. The two sacrificial cruisers were, as with the previous attack, accompanied by four heavy monitors under Keyes' command, eight destroyers under Lynes in HMS Faulknor and five motor launches. The launches, like the blockships, were all crewed by volunteers; mostly veterans of previous operations against the Belgian ports. The plan was similar to the failed operation of three weeks previously. Weather dependent, under cover of a smoke screen, aerial bombardment and offshore artillery, the blockships would steam directly into the channel, turn sideways and scuttle themselves. Their advance would be covered by artillery fire against German shore positions from the heavy monitors at distance and at closer range by gunfire from the destroyers. This cover was vital because Ostend was protected by a very strong 11'' gun position known as the Tirpitz battery. Once the operation had been concluded, the motor launches would draw along the seaward side of the blockships, remove the surviving crews and take them to the monitors for passage back to Britain. This operation should thoroughly block the channel and coupled with the blockage at Zeebrugge -LRB-which the British authorities believed to be fully closed-RRB-, should prevent use of Bruges by German raiding craft for months to come. -LSB-edit-RSB- Attack on Ostend All preparations for the operation were completed by the first week of May and on the 9 May the weather was near-perfect for the attack. The British armada had collected at Dunkirk in Allied-held France and departed port shortly after dark. Two minutes after midnight, the force suffered a setback when Sappho suffered a minor boiler explosion and had to return to Dunkirk, unable to complete the journey. Although this accident halved the ability of the force to block Ostend, Lynes decided to continue the operation, and at 01.30, the force closed on the port, making the final preparations for the assault. Torpedoes fired from motor launches demolished machine gun posts on the ends of the piers marking the canal, beginning the attack. Ten heavy bombers of the newly-formed Royal Air Force then flew over, dropping incendiary bombs on German positions but not causing significant damage. At the same time, long range artillery of the Royal Marine Artillery opened fire on Ostend from Allied positions around the Belgian town of Ypres. In preparation for the attack, Godsal and Lynes had carefully consulted available charts of Ostend following the previous operation's failure caused by German repositioning of navigation buoys. This careful study was however rendered worthless by a sudden fog which obliterated all sight of the shore. Steaming back and forth across the harbour entrance in the fog as the monitors and German shore batteries engaged in a long range artillery duel over the lost cruiser, Godsal looked for the piers marking the entrance to the canal. As he searched, two German torpedo boats sailed from Ostend to intercept the cruiser, but in the heavy fog they collided and, disabled, limped back to shore. During this period, Godsal's motor launches lost track of the cruiser in the murk, and it was not until the third pass that Vindictive found the entrance, accompanied by only one of the launches. Heading straight into the mouth of the canal, guided by a flare dropped by the launch, Vindictive became an instant target of the German batteries and was badly damaged, the shellfire exacerbating the damage suffered in the earlier Zeebrugge Raid and seriously damaging Vindictive's port propeller. Alfred Godsal intended to swing Vindictive broadside on into the channel mouth but as he ordered the turn, the right screw broke down completely, preventing the cruiser from fully turning. Before this was realised on the cruiser's bridge, a shell fired from a gun battery on shore struck Commander Godsal directly, killing him instantly and shattering the bridge structure. Most of the bridge crew were killed or wounded by the blast, including First Lieutenant Victor Crutchley, who staggered to the wheel and attempted to force the ship to make the full turn into the channel. The damaged propeller made this move impossible and the drifting cruiser floated out of the channel and became stuck on a sandbank outside, only partially obscuring the entrance way. -LSB-edit-RSB- Evacuation of HMS Vindictive Realising that further manoeuvring would be pointless, Crutchley ordered the charges to be blown and the ship evacuated. As Engineer-Lieutenant William Bury prepared to detonate the scuttling charges, Crutchley took a survey of the ship and ordered all survivors to take to the boats on the seaward side of the wreck. As men scrambled down the ship's flank away from the shells and machine-gun bullets spitting from the harbour entrance, Crutchley made a final survey with an electric torch looking for wounded men amongst the dead on the decks. Satisfied that none alive remained aboard, he too leapt onto the deck of a motor launch bobbing below. The rescue mission itself however was not going as planned. Of the five motor launches attached to the expedition, only one had remained with cruiser in the fog; ML254 commanded by Lieutenant Geoffrey Drummond. The launch, like the cruiser, was riddled with bullets; her commander was wounded and her executive officer dead. Despite her sheltered position behind the cruiser, fire from shore continued to enfilade the launch and a number of those aboard, including Lieutenant Bury, suffered broken ankles as they jumped onto the heaving deck. ML254 then began slowly to leave the harbour mouth, carrying 38 survivors of Vindictive's 55 crew huddled on deck, where they remained exposed to machine gun fire from the shore. As Drummond turned his boat seawards and proceeded back to the offshore squadron which was still engaged in an artillery duel with the German defenders, one of the missing launches, ML276 passed her, having caught up with the lost cruiser at this late stage. Drummond called to ML276's commander, Lieutenant Rowley Bourke, that he believed there were still men in the water and Bourke immediately entered the harbour to search for them. Drummond's launch proceeded to the rendezvous with the destroyer HMS Warwick, overweighted and sinking, so severe was the damage she had suffered. Hearing cries, Bourke entered the harbour but could not identify the lost men. Despite heavy machine gun and artillery fire, Bourke returned to the scene of the wreck four times before they discovered two sailors and the Vindictive's badly wounded navigation officer Sir John Alleyne clinging to an upturned boat. Hauling the men aboard, Bourke turned for the safety of the open sea but as he did two 6'' shells struck the launch, smashing the lifeboat and destroying the compressed air tanks, which stalled the engines and caused a wave of highly corrosive acid to wash over the deck, causing severe damage to the launch's hull and almost suffocating the unconscious Alleyne. Under heavy fire, the boat staggered out of the harbour and was taken under tow by another late-arriving motor launch. After the operation, Bourke's launch was discovered to have 55 separate bullet and shrapnel holes. Offshore, as the Warwick's officers, Keyes' staff and the survivors of the Vindictive gathered on the destroyer's deck to discuss the operation, an enormous explosion rocked the ship causing her to list severely. The Warwick had struck one of the defensive mines off Ostend and was now in danger of sinking herself. The destroyer HMS Velox was lashed alongside and survivors from Warwick, Vindictive and ML254 transferred across to the sound ship. This ragged ensemble did not reach Dover until early the following morning, the Warwick still afloat. British casualties were reported in the immediate aftermath as being eight dead, ten missing and 29 wounded. German losses were three killed and eight wounded. -LSB-edit-RSB- Aftermath Despite German claims that the blockage did not impede their operations, the operation to close the Ostend canal seemed to have been at least partially successful. The channel was largely blocked and so Bruges was ostensibly closed off from the open sea, even if the position of the blockship meant that smaller ships could get through. In fact, however, the entire operation had been rendered moot before it even began, due to events at the wider canal in Zeebrugge. British assessments of that operation had ultimately proven optimistic and the channel there had not been properly closed. Small coastal submarines of the UC Class had been able to pass through the channel as early as the morning after the Zeebrugge Raid and German naval engineers were able to dredge channels around the blockages at both ports over the coming weeks. At Ostend, the Vindictive did prevent larger warships passing through the channel, although smaller craft could still come and go at will. Ultimately, the larger warships in Bruges were trapped there for the remaining months of the war; the town was captured by the Allies in October 1918. Ultimately the blockages at Ostend and Zeebrugge took several years to clear completely, not being totally removed until 1921. On a strategic scale however, the effects of the raids at Ostend and Zeebrugge on the battle of the Atlantic were negligible. Despite this ultimate failure, in Britain the Ostend Raid was feted as a success. Three Victoria Crosses and a host of lesser awards were given to the men involved. The Admiralty presented it as a fine example of daring and careful planning from the Royal Navy, providing a valuable morale boost at one of the most critical moments of the war. Heading straight into the mouth of the canal, guided by a flare dropped by the launch, Vindictive became an instant target of the German batteries and was badly damaged, the shellfire exacerbating the damage suffered in the earlier Zeebrugge Raid and seriously damaging Vindictive's port propeller.

Each player is assigned direct control of a single character. The game's developers, Planet Moon Studios, created this design to encourage players to focus on the action and not to be burdened with micromanagement. Players can customize the controls, which are largely the same for each race, with slight differences for abilities. The single-player mode consists of a sequence of missions set as an overarching story. Each mission requires the completion of certain objectives to progress to the next mission. The objectives are usually the elimination of enemies or a certain structure, but several of them test the player's eye--hand coordination or require the player to rescue and protect certain units. Players control their characters from a default third person perspective; a first person view is optional. Each race has its own offensive style, and a special mode of fast movement. Killing a creature releases a power-up, which heals or awards weapons to its collector. The real-time strategy elements of Giants consist of base building and resource gathering. Players have to gather little humanoids called Smarties to build bases, and produce weapons or spells. There are a limited number of Smarties in a mission, and players have to rush to gather them, or kidnap them from each other to gain an advantage. Players also have to gather sustenance for the Smarties to make them work; Meccaryn and Reaper players hunt the cattle-like Vimps for meat and souls respectively. The options in building a base are limited; players can neither choose the locations for the structures nor manage their workforce in detail. In contrast, players in control of Kabuto need not build a base; the gigantic creature gains strength and produces troops through hunting for food. Kabuto consumes Smarties to grow in size and power; at maximum size, he can produce smaller Tyrannosaurus rex-like units to function as troops. To restore his health, Kabuto eats Vimps and other units -LRB-player- and computer-controlled-RRB-. Multiplayer mode allows a maximum of five Meccaryn, three Sea Reaper, and one Kabuto player-LRB-s-RRB- to play in each session. Due to the lack of a game server browser, players connect through online services MPlayer or GameSpy Arcade for the Windows version, and GameRanger for the Mac OS�X version. Besides the standard ``destroy all enemy bases and units'' missions, the multiplayer mode includes deathmatches and ``Capture the Smartie -LRB-flag-RRB-''-type games. Players have the option to start everyone off with a full base or to build one from scratch. -LSB-edit-RSB- Plot and settings The game world of Giants is set on the fictional Island, a piece of rock that is hurtling through outer space. The surface of the rock comprises islands of varying environments, such as grasslands, deserts, and forests, surrounded by azure seas. Players have an unobstructed view of the game world up to its horizon; distant objects are slightly blurred to convey a sense of realism. Planet Moon Studios tailored each single-player mission's terrain to the character played in it. As such, missions for Meccaryns provide a lot of cover to hide behind and shoot from, large spaces of water for Reapers to swim in, and plenty of creatures for Kabuto to eat. -LSB-edit-RSB- Characters Planet Moon intended for the player characters to provide a diverse gameplay experience, laying down requirements to make the characters distinct with unique advantages and disadvantages instead of cosmetic differences. For non-playable races, the team designed Smarties to have oversized heads, bulging eyes, and idiotic personalities for comedic effects. They set up the Smarties' work ethics as part of a visual reward system; players labor for the Smarties while witnessing their hedonistic indulgences. The payoff, however, is a ``giant gun''. Standard enemies include Reaper Guards, male Reapers with no magical ability who serve as common soldiers, as well as fauna such as the insectoid Rippers, beasts of burden Sonaks, and bat-like Verms. -LSB-edit-RSB- Story Originally featuring each race in its own stand-alone story, the single-player mode was changed by Planet Moon to a single sequential story to make the creative process simpler. It starts players off as Baz, and they must complete a sequence of missions before they can proceed to the next sequence in the role of Delphi. On completion of Delphi's story, players take control of a Kabuto character. Williams used cut scenes to introduce and conclude each mission, focusing on humor to make them original and interesting rewards for the players. As Baz, the player is on the Island looking for the missing Meccaryns, Reg and Tel.. Timmy, a Smartie rescued in the first mission, functions as a guide for the player; he also serves as a plot device to move the plot forward, such as introducing other Smartie characters, and providing exposition on the back story. The plot portrays the Smarties as suffering under the reign of the Sea Reapers and their Queen Sappho. Alluding to the film, The Magnificent Seven, Baz gathers the separated Meccaryns, and takes on a quest to solve the Smarties' predicaments. In a climactic cut scene, Sappho sacrifices Timmy to Kabuto, and the young Smartie's grandfather, Borjoyzee, takes over as the player's guide. Baz leads an escape from the area, and sets up a base to lead a counterattack. The ending of the Meccaryn's story sets the back story for the player to assume the role of the Sea Reaper princess, Delphi. Yan, the Samurai Smartie serves as the guide for this story segment; giving instructions on Delphi's abilities. After completing the training missions under Yan, Delphi proceeds on missions to attack Sappho's base and the Reapers, eventually confronting the queen in a boss fight. When defeated, Sappho summons Kabuto to destroy the Smarties, but in a plot twist, Kabuto eats her instead. Setting up the final stretch of the story, Delphi has transformed herself into a Kabuto-like creature to challenge the original. The player wanders around the islands as the Delphi-Kabuto character, searching for prey to increase her size. After Delphi-Kabuto achieves her maximum size, she proceeds to a boss fight with the original Kabuto. Despite her victory, Kabuto revives in a triggered cut scene and defeats her, turning her back into a Reaper. The player takes over the role of Baz for the final boss fight against the revived monster. After defeating Kabuto, Baz is shown in the final cut scene, flying off to Planet Majorca with Delphi, Borjoyzee, and his fellow Meccaryns. -LSB-edit-RSB- Development When five members of Shiny Entertainment's MDK development team broke off to set up Planet Moon Studios in 1997 with software engineer, Scott Guest, they decided to make their first project fun and original, a game with graphics and gameplay unseen at that time. Nicky Bruty, Bob Stevenson, and Tim Williams initially conceived the idea of pitting players as spacemen, pirates, and giants against each other and having fun. Initially projected for release in late 1999, the game suffered delays to its development largely due to the illness of their chief programmer, Andy Astor; he was suffering from stage IV mantle cell lymphoma in late 1999. The team realized they needed more resources and by 2000, they had hired two more programmers and an artist. Producing a next-generation game required them to keep up with 1998--2000's rapid advancement of technology, which resulted in further delays. The team upsized the graphic textures as they changed the graphical software to support NVIDIA graphics cards. Within a year after development started in 1999, the initial minimum graphics specification climbed from requiring Voodoo 1 graphics cards to those of the GeForce-series. Planet Moon deemed game engines available during development too restrictive and inappropriate for their requirements, and built their own. Called Amityville, it could support Glide, OpenGL, and Direct3D. The team used it to create the required ``lush and vibrant'' outdoor environments, and terrain deformation effects. Planet Moon designed the structure of the single-player mode to be a gradual learning process for the players; the game would introduce new command sets to the players as they progress, and encourage them to repeat using the new commands for that mission. From the start of the project, the team intended the controls to be simple, and mapped commonly used commands to a few keys. Focus groups consisting more than 25 testers went through this design to verify its ease. Planet Moon aimed for a complex artificial intelligence -LRB-AI-RRB-; computer-controlled characters would evade shots and take cover. The enemy AI would plot its actions according to long-term goals. The development team consulted Mark Frohnmayer, lead programmer of the multiplayer game Tribes 2, for advice on implementing the multiplayer portion. To balance the characters in combat, Planet Moon focused on characteristics that could affect the fighting capabilities, instead of tweaking the damage output. The team faced a tight schedule, and abandoned several features initially in the game. Early designs allowed players to change the landscape; they could gorge out water channels and isolate segments of the land by playing as Reapers. The Kabuto character initially could bake mud into ``mud shepherd'' units and use them to defend its herd of food. Interplay Entertainment released the Windows version of the game on December 7, 2000. Planet Moon later created a special version of the game optimized for the GeForce 3 graphics card to display water reflections, soft edged shadows, and weather effects. This version was not sold as a standalone commercial product but as a part of certain GeForce�3 graphic card package deals. MacPlay announced on November 01, 2000, it was publishing the Mac OS X version of the game. The Omni Group was responsible for the porting of the game; they rewrote the game's software to take advantage of the symmetric multi-processing capability of Mac OS�X. Eleven months later, MacPlay released the port. Multiplayer mode was initially disabled in the retail release but was re-inserted in a later patch. Giants was also ported to the PlayStation 2 -LRB-PS2-RRB-, a process overseen by Interplay's division, Digital Mayhem, who posted updates of their progress on IGN. Their greatest challenge for the PS2 port was converting and storing the special effects of the Windows version onto the lesser storage space of the PS2. LightWave 3D was used by the team to convert the graphic resources. Although they had to reduce the image resolution, Digital Mayhem increased the number of polygons that comprised the player character models, making them smoother and more detailed in shape. Due to the limited capabilities of the PS2 as compared to the Windows platform and the addition of a save feature, the team focused on enhancing the action gameplay, streamlining the interfaces, and tweaking the Reaper ski races, level designs, and game balance. They redesigned the controls for the PS2's controller, and after finding the analog sticks less easy to aim with than a mouse, implemented a feature to help the player's aim. Digital Mayhem originally intended to retain the multiplayer mode, but discarded it, believing the PS2 environment could not generate the same multiplayer atmosphere as the Windows platform. Interplay released the PS2 port on December 21, 2001. They also announced plans for an Xbox port but nothing resulted from this. Near the release of the United States -LRB-US-RRB- Windows version of the game, Planet Moon failed to obtain a ``Teen'' rating from the ESRB despite changing the original red blood to green and covering Delphi's toplessness with a bikini top. They made the changes to broaden retail opportunities because many large retailers in the US refused to sell ``Mature''-rated games; Wal-Mart reiterated in October 2002 that they would never stock their shelves with software that contained vulgarity or nudity. Planet Moon Studios later released a patch that reverted the color of the blood to red, and computer gamers found they could restore Delphi's toplessness by deleting a file. Interplay offered a bonus disc containing extra multiplayer levels to those who pre-ordered the Windows version of the game. On October 5, 2003, they offered the game's soundtrack to those who purchased Giants from their online store. Composers Mark Snow -LRB-noted for his The X-Files musical scores-RRB-, Mark Morgan, and Jeremy Soule -LRB-both known for the music of several video games-RRB- were involved in the music for Giants. Interplay hired Morgan to compose the scores, although reports showed they initially hired Snow for the task. Morgan, however, could not fully concentrate on the task due to personal reasons and handed it over to Soule. Closing credits of the game listed only Morgan and Soule, and Soule compiled their works onto the original soundtrack of the game. Soule originally offered to autograph the soundtrack on its release in the US; however, he stopped his offer when email feedback revealed many were intending to pirate his work through the peer-to-peer file sharing software Napster instead of buying it. -LSB-edit-RSB- Reception Planet Moon Studios' blending of two genres in Giants has earned the acclaim of reviewers. Game Revolution and GameSpot found the simplified real-time strategy task of resource gathering in Giants more interesting than tedious, and Troy Dunniway, Microsoft's Head of Game Design in 2002, commented that the real-time strategy elements enhanced the game's shooter aspect rather than making it a hybrid of two genres. Sci Fi Weekly was impressed that both styles of play never interfered with each other, which was complemented by the unique gameplay of each race. The Entertainment Depot, however, found the base building in several missions tedious; they said the player had to rebuild the base several times due to being forced to leave the base defenseless, which allowed the enemy destroy the structures. Reviewers commented that the imaginative character designs and use of advanced graphics technology, such as hardware transform and lighting, and bump mapping, made the graphics of the game unrivaled in its time; ActionTrip was so impressed by the game's visuals that they thought their graphics card was supporting the complex hardware environmental bump mapping it was incapable of. The animation of Kabuto's antics such as elbow dropping onto tiny enemies, and tossing up and catching food with his mouth, in particular, won the praises of reviewers. Many critics, however, were disappointed that the computer versions of the game could not run smoothly at full details on the recommended system specifications. The AI in the game was also the subject of much commentary. Reviewers said they needed to prompt the allied non-player characters to perform actions on several occasions, although the allied AI performed pretty well most of the time. FiringSquad disagreed, calling their computer controlled teammates worthless and finding joy in leaving them to their deaths. The game review site thought the same of the enemy AI, a view echoed by IGN; enemies were unaware of the deaths of nearby teammates, and kept running into obstacles. ActionTrip, however, stated the enemy AI did well enough to take cover or flee when hurt, and constantly attack the player's base. Many reviewers found the best part of Giants to be its bawdy humor; the scenes were ``bizarre and funny without ever letting the silliness distract or annoy the player''. FiringSquad claimed the humor kept them plowing through the game regardless of the issues they encountered, and were disappointed when the game steadily lost this approach in the later stages. Mac Guild and Macworld UK, however, considered the humor crude on a child-like level and its delivery forced. In spite of the humor, many reviewers found themselves bored by the monotony and slow pace of certain segments, According to ActionTrip, Giants lacked a unique quality to capture attention, compared to its contemporaries such as American McGee's Alice, MechWarrior 4: Vengeance, and Sea Dogs. The frequent crashes of the retail Windows versions infuriated many reviewers; Game Revolution censured Interplay for focusing on censoring the game for marketing purposes instead of testing for and fixing the software bugs before release. Several reviewers could not connect to multiplayer games due to failed connections or bugs. The reviewers who managed to play online, commented the games were fun, although they were occasionally disconnected or lagged. GamesFirst lamented the lack of dedicated low ping servers, and several reviewers declared that the computer versions of the game was flawed for not implementing an in-game save feature. Reviewers appreciated the PS2 version for including the asked-for save feature, but complained the ported game retained the AI and level design issues associated with the Windows version. IGN remarked that it looked less impressive than the computer versions. The lower resolution, flat textures, washed out colors, and sparser environments made the game average looking. The PS2 version also exhibited clipping issues; character models and projectiles would pass through objects on occasion. The game reviewer, however, praised the console version for presenting a smooth animation, rarely dropping frames. On the contrary, other reviewers stated the frame rate dropped when there are several objects on the screen, presenting a heavy load on the graphics engine. The lack of replay value for the console version after completing the single player mode was a common complaint among the reviewers. Review aggregators Metacritic and Gamerankings calculated scores of 85 and 86.7% from their selected reviews for Giants as of 2007. Although most critics had awarded high scores to the game, GamesRadar and GSoundtracks reported the Windows version sold poorly. In contrast, the Mac OS�X version sold out within months of its release, in spite of its smaller market base. According to the quarterly sales reports by NPDFunWorld, the PS2 version sold 11,272�copies in the US for the six months since its release. This is a poor sales figure compared to the 51,726�copies of Shadow Hearts and 753,251�copies of Max Payne sold in the same period for the PS2. Despite the poor overall sales, reviewers have nominated Giants as a game deserving a sequel, and have kept it on PC Gamer UK's Top�100 as of 2007. In 2009, Andrew Groen of GameZone ran a retrospective on Giants and suggested that the game's mix of humor and action inspired later games such as Ratchet & Clank and Jak and Daxter. He further commented that games of 2004--09 were influenced by Giants in one way or another. The game's developers, Planet Moon Studios, created this design to encourage players to focus on the action and not to be burdened with micromanagement.

Vegetation and game in the region was similar to what is there today by the time people started to settle Yosemite Valley 3000 years ago. Western slopes of the Sierra Nevada had acorns, deer and salmon while the eastern Sierra had pinyon nuts and obsidian. Native American groups traveled between these two areas to trade and raid. Archaeologists divide the pre-Euro-American contact period of the region into three cultural phases. The Crane Flat phase lasted from 1000�BCE to the year 500. Hunting with the atl atl and use of grinding stones occurred during this period. The Tarmarack phase lasted from the year 500 to 1200 and is marked by a shift to using smaller rock points, which indicates development and use of the bow and arrow. Acorns also become a part of the diet at this time. The Mariposa phase lasted from 1200 until contact with Euro-Americans. Trade between tribes became more widespread during this period and the diet continued to improve. Miwok, Monos and Shoshonean-speaking tribes visited the area to trade. A major trading route went over Mono Pass and through Bloody Canyon to Mono Lake in Eastern Californian. In the 11th or 12th century a band of indigenous people who called the valley that provided them with nuts, berries, and small game Ahwahnee -LRB-meaning ``place of a gaping mouth''-RRB- moved into the valley. They called themselves the Ah-wah-ne-chee -LRB-meaning dwellers in Ahwahnee-RRB-. Like humans before and since, the Ahwahnechee changed the Valley to suit their needs. Since the band depended upon acorns for 60% of their diet, they burned vegetation on the Valley floor, which favored California Black Oak - an acorn-producing tree. Fire management also expanded meadows and reduced brush within woodlands, thus making ambush by invading tribes difficult. Displaced Native Americans from the coast of California moved to the Sierra Nevada in the early to mid-19th century. They brought their experiences with Spanish food, technology, and clothing as they joined tribes in the mountains. Together they raided ranchos on the coast and drove herds of horses to the Sierra, where horse meat became a major new food source. The Shoshonean-speaking Monache moved from eastern deserts into the southern Sierra in the last three to five hundred years. -LSB-edit-RSB- Exploration by Europeans Significant debate still surrounds the issue of who the first non-indigenous person to see the Valley was. Spanish missions and colonies existed along the coast of California but no Spanish explorers visited the Sierra Nevada. A group led by American fur trapper Jedediah Smith became the first Euro-Americans to cross the Sierra Nevada. They crossed at Ebbetts Pass, north of the Yosemite area in May 1827. In the autumn of 1833, a group led by Joseph Reddeford Walker may have seen Yosemite Valley but did not enter it. Walker approached a valley rim as he led his party of trappers across the Sierra Nevada. A member of the party, Zenas Leonard, wrote in his journal that streams from the valley rim dropped ''... from one lofty precipice to another, until they are exhausted in rain below. Some of these precipices appeared to us to be more than a mile high.'' In 1839 a print shop fire in Philadelphia destroyed journals related to the Walker group. He and his party also likely happened upon either the Tuolumne or Merced Groves of Giant Sequoia, becoming the first known non-indigenous people to see the giant trees. The part of the Sierra Nevada where the park is located was long considered to be a physical barrier to non-indigenous settlers, traders, trappers, and travelers. That status changed, in 1848, due to the discovery of gold in the foothills west of the range in the California Gold Rush. Travel and trade activity dramatically increased in the area, competing with the local Native Americans and destroying resources they depended upon. Disease from the newcommers spread rapidly through Native American populations and extermination of native culture became a policy of the United States Government, which obtained California from Mexico in 1848. The first reliable sighting of the Valley by a non-indigenous person occurred on October 18, 1849 by William P. Abrams and a companion. Abrams accurately described some landmarks but it is not known for sure whether or not he or his companion actually entered the Valley. In 1850, Joseph Screech became the first confirmed non-indigenous person to enter Hetch Hetchy Valley. He settled there, and noted that the Paiutes inhabited Hetch Hetchy before the coming of the Europeans. The first intentional and systematic exploration of any part of the Yosemite area backcountry was conducted in 1855 by the surveying crew of Allexey W. Von Schmidt, as part of the Public Land Survey System. Von Schmidt's charge was to establish the Mount Diablo Base Line from the initial point at Mount Diablo east across the Sierra Nevada, preliminary to the General Land Office -LRB-GLO-RRB- rectangular survey in California and Nevada. This line passes through Tuolumne Meadows and very near the summit of Mount Dana, -LRB-although Von Schmidt, for unknown reasons, surveyed his line 5 to 6�miles -LRB-9.7�km-RRB- south of the actual line, which was not surveyed until around 1880-RRB-. This survey was the first crossing of the Sierra Nevada that did not follow established trails or the natural routes suggested by topography. In 1863--67, the California Geological Survey surveyed parts of Yosemite's high country and the boundary of the new state park. From 1879 to 1883 large areas of the park were contracted for survey by GLO contract surveyors. However, the individual contracted for the largest area, one S.A. Hanson, was associated with the Benson Syndicate, and he combined actual with probably fabricated surveys. In 1878--79 topographic surveys performed by Lieutenant Montgomery Macomb, under George M Wheeler's Surveys West of the 100th Meridian, made use of various peaks in the high country to connect with Wheeler's extensive surveys further east, north and south. -LSB-edit-RSB- Mariposa Wars and legacy A mining camp was established in 1849 at Big Oak Flat on tributaries of the Tuolumne River. James Savage was running a mining operation and trading camp on the Merced River 10�miles -LRB-16�km-RRB- west of Yosemite Valley by 1850. He ran a similar camp near Mariposa. Both camps were raided by Native Americans in December 1850. The raiders retreated back in the mountains. In 1851 the Mariposa Battalion was created under the authority of the Governor of California to put an end to these raids and starting the Mariposa Wars. James Savage led the Battalion into Yosemite Valley in 1851 while in pursuit of around 200 Ahwaneechees led by Chief Tenaya. On Thursday March 27 of that year the company of 50 to 60 men reached what is now called Old Inspiration Point and saw the major features of the Valley laid out before them -LRB-they named the overlook Mt. Beatitude-RRB-. Attached to Savage's unit was Dr. Lafayette Bunnell, the company physician who later wrote about his awestruck impressions of the valley in The Discovery of the Yosemite. While camped at Bridalveil Meadow Bunnell suggested that the Valley be named '``Yo-sem-ity'', after what the surrounding Sierra Miwok tribes, who feared the Yosemite Valley tribe, called them. At the time, Savage, who spoke some native dialects, translated this as ``full-grown grizzly bear''. Later translations found that the actual term, while possibly derived or at least confused with the similar uzumati or uhumati -LRB-meaning `grizzly bear'-RRB-, was in fact a Southern Sierra Miwok word Yohhe`meti meaning ``they are killers''. The name stuck even though the tribe they named the valley after called themselves Ahwahnechee. Bunnell went on to name many other local topographic features on the same trip. Others in the company were also moved by what they saw and recounted their journey to friends and family after they returned, increasing interest in the Valley and surrounding area. Bunnell soon after drafted an article about the trip, but destroyed it when a newspaper correspondent in San Francisco suggested cutting his 1500�foot -LRB-460�m-RRB- height estimate for the Valley walls in half -LRB-the walls are in fact twice the height that Bunnell surmised-RRB-. So the first published account of the Valley was written by Lt. Tredwell Moore for the January 20, 1854 issue of the Mariposa Chronicle. The modern spelling of Yosemite was established by that article. Chief Tenaya and his band were eventually captured and their village burned, fulfilling a prophecy an old and dying medicine man gave Tenaya many years before. The Ahwahnechee were escorted by their captor Captain John Bowling to the Fresno River Reservation. Life on the reservation was unpleasant and the Ahwahneechee longed for their valley, prompting reservation officials to allow Tenaya and some of his band to return on their own recognizance in winter. A group of eight miners entered the Valley in the Spring of 1852 and were allegedly attacked by Tenaya's warriors, with two of the miners being killed. A second battalion was organized, and executed six Ahwahneechee under the direction of Lt. Moore. Tenaya's band fled the Valley and sought refuge with the Mono, his mother's tribe. In Summer or early Fall of 1853, the Ahwahneechee apparently returned to the Valley, but later betrayed the hospitality of their former Mono hosts by stealing some horses that the Mono had taken from non-indigenous ranchers. In return the Monos tracked down and killed many of the remaining Ahwahneechee, including Tenaya. Tenaya Lake is named after the fallen chief. Hostilities then subsided, and by the mid 1850s local non-indigenous residents started to befriend Native Americans living in the Yosemite area. Mono Paiutes were the only group that kept returning to the Valley on a regular basis. They lived in established native villages in the Valley into the early 20th century. As older tribe members died, younger ones tended to favor non-traditional housing provided by the National Park Service. A few Paiute and Miwok families still live in the Valley and are employed by the Park Service. A reconstructed ``Indian Village of Ahwahnee'' is now located behind the Yosemite Museum, which is next to the Yosemite Valley Visitor Center. The museum has exhibits that interpret the cultural history of Yosemite's indigenous residents from 1850 to the present. In addition, the museum has regularly scheduled demonstrations of basket-weaving, beadwork, and traditional games by Native American presenters. -LSB-edit-RSB- Popularization, exploitation, and protection -LSB-edit-RSB- Artists, photographers, and the first tourists Forty-eight people ventured into Yosemite Valley in 1855. Among these were San Francisco writer James Mason Hutchings and artist Thomas Ayres. After returning to Mariposa Hutchings wrote an article about his experience which appeared in the July 12, 1855 issue of the Mariposa Gazette and was later published in various forms nationally. , Ayres' sketch of Yosemite Falls was published in fall that year, and four of his drawings were presented in the lead article of the July 1856 and initial issue of Hutchings' Illustrated California Magazine. These were the first known accurate pictures of Yosemite Valley. Ayres returned in 1856 and visited Tuolumne Meadows in the area's high country. His highly-detailed but angularly-exaggerated artwork and his written accounts were published nationally. An art exhibition of his drawings was later held in New York City. Hutchings brought photographer Charles Leander Weed to the Valley in 1859. Weed took the first photographs of the Valley's features, and a September exhibition in San Francisco presented them to the public. Hutchings published four installments of ``The Great Yo-semite Valley'' from October 1859 to March 1860 in his magazine. A book by Hutchings titled Scenes of Wonder and Curiosity in California collected these articles and the book stayed in print well into the 1870s. Stanford University mechanical engineering student Arthur Clarence Pillsbury arrived in Yosemite for the first time by bicycle in 1895. The young man fell in love with Yosemite and in 1897 bought a studio there. He visited Yosemite many times and photographed Muir, Galen Clark, George Fiske, and Teddy Roosevelt. These photos were published as postcards by the Pillsbury Picture Company. Pillsbury had begun producing postcards with his photos as soon as this innovative form of communication was authorized by Congress in 1898. His many nature films, eventually shown in theaters as well as in schools, clubs and for his lecture tours awakened the public to the need for conservation in the wake of Muir's death in 1914. Photographer Ansel Adams, who made his first trip to Yosemite in 1916, was famous for his photographs of Yosemite in the 1920s and 30s. He willed the originals of his Yosemite photos to the Yosemite Park Association, and visitors can still buy direct prints from his original negatives. The studio in which prints are sold was established in 1902 by artist Harry Cassie Best. Carleton Watkins exhibited his 17x22-inch Yosemite views at the 1867 Paris International Exposition. In 1856, Milton and Houston Mann -LRB-2 of 42 tourists to visit the valley the year before-RRB- finished a toll road to the Valley that traveled up the South Fork of the Merced River. Before they were bought out by Mariposa County they charged the then large sum of two dollars per person. Under county control the road was free. Wawona was an indigenous encampment in what is now the southwestern part of the park. Settler Galen Clark discovered the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoia in Wawona in 1856; a year later he completed a bridge over the South Fork Merced in Wawona for traffic inbound to the Valley. Clark also provided a way station for tourists traveling on the road that the Mann brothers built to the Valley. Simple lodgings, later called the Lower Hotel, were completed soon afterward; Upper Hotel -LRB-later renamed Hutchings House and now known as Cedar Cottage-RRB- was opened in 1858. In 1879, the more substantial Wawona Hotel was built to serve tourists visiting the nearby Grove and those on their way to the Valley -LRB-at the time, it took 8 hours to travel from Wawona to the Valley via stage-RRB-. The Washburns, owners of the hotel, bought Clark's land and covered the bridge he built. A year before the hotel was completed, A. Harris built the first public campground in Yosemite. As tourism increased, the number of trails and hotels also increased. -LSB-edit-RSB- Early protection efforts and the state park Visitation and interest in Yosemite continued through the American Civil War. A Unitarian minister named Thomas Starr King visited the Valley in 1860 and saw some of the negative effects that homesteading and commercial activity were having on the area. Six travel letters by King were published in the Boston Evening Transcript in 1860 and 1861 -LRB-Oliver Wendell Holmes and John Greenleaf Whittier read and commented on them-RRB-. King went on to become the first person with a nationally-recognized voice to call for a public Yosemite park. Frederick Law Olmsted, the United States' most widely respected landscape architect, became interested by Kings' warnings and visited Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove in 1863. Pressure by King and Olmstead, photographs by famed photographer Carleton Watkins, and geologic data from the 1863 Geological Survey of California prompted legislators to take notice. Senator John Conness of California introduced a Park bill in 1864 to the United States Senate that would cede Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove to California. The uncontroversial bill passed both houses of the United States Congress and was signed by President Abraham Lincoln on June 30, 1864, creating the Yosemite Grant as a public trust. Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove were ceded to California as a state park for ``public use, resort and recreation.'' A board of Yosemite commissioners was proclaimed by the state's governor September that year, but the body did not convene until 1866 -LRB-with Frederick Law Olmsted as chairman-RRB-. Galen Clark was appointed by the commission as the park's first guardian, but neither Clark nor the commissioners had the authority to evict homesteaders, starting an 11 year struggle. Josiah Whitney, the first director of the California Geological Survey, lamented that Yosemite Valley may become like what Niagara Falls was at the time�-- a tourist trap where proprietary interests place tolls on every bridge, path, trail, and viewpoint. Hutchings was one of a small group that wanted homesteading rights on 160�acres -LRB-65�ha-RRB- of the valley floor. The issue was not settled until 1875 when the land holdings of Hutchings and three others were invalidated. A State grant of $24,000 for improvements Hutchings made to Upper Hotel helped compensate for his loss. Two years after losing his land, Hutchings published a second Yosemite guide, Hutchings' Tourist Guide to the Yosemite Valley and the Big Tree Groves. Under Clark's on and off stewardship through 1896, access to the park by tourists improved, and conditions in the Valley were made more hospitable to humans. Tourism started to significantly increase after a Sacramento to Stockton extension of the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869 and the Central Pacific Railroad reached Merced in 1872. The long horseback ride needed to reach the area was still a deterrent, so three stagecoach roads were built in the mid-1870s to provide better access; Coulterville Road -LRB-June 1874-RRB-, Big Oak Flat Road -LRB-July 1874-RRB-, and the Mariposa/Wawona Road -LRB-July 1875-RRB-. A road to Glacier Point was completed in 1882 by John Conway, and the Great Sierra Wagon Road was opened in 1883 -LRB-roughly following the Mono Trail to Tuolumne Meadows-RRB-. Yosemite's oldest concession was established in 1884 when Mr. and Mrs. John Degnan established a bakery and store. Perhaps the most famous concession, the Curry Company, was started by David and Jenny Curry in 1899 -LRB-they founded Camp Curry, now known as Curry Village-RRB-. The Currys lobbied reluctant park supervisors to expand concessionaire operations and development in the area. In 1900 Oliver Lippincott became the first person to drive an automobile into the Valley. Yosemite Valley Railroad, nicknamed ``the short line to paradise'', arrived at nearby El Portal, California in 1907. Tourists transferred from the railway to stagecoaches that traveled through Merced Canyon to reach Yosemite Valley. Life on the Valley floor was plagued by mosquitoes and the threat of contracting diseases they carry. So in 1878 Clark used dynamite to breach a recessional moraine in the valley that impounded a swamp behind it. Numerous hiking and horse trails were also cleared, including a walking path through Mariposa Grove. Clark and the reigning commissioners were ousted in 1880 by the California Legislature and Hutchings became the new park guardian. That same year Bunnell's account of the Valley's discovery was finally published. Hutchings in turn was removed as guardian in 1884 and was replaced by W.E. Dennison. Clark was reappointed as guardian in 1889. -LSB-edit-RSB- John Muir's influence and the national park Scotland-born naturalist John Muir first came to California in March 1868 and immediately set out for the Yosemite area. Muir studied the area's plants, rocks and animals in the summer of 1869 while employed by rancher Pat Delaney to accompany his sheep and sheepherder. Soon after, Hutchings hired Muir to operate a sawmill. Articles written by Muir helped to both popularize the area and increase scientific interest in it. Muir was one of the first to theorize that the major landforms in Yosemite were created by large alpine glaciers, bucking established scientists such as Josiah Whitney who regarded Muir as an amateur -LRB-see geology of the Yosemite area-RRB-. Muir also wrote scientific papers on the area's biology. Alarmed by over-grazing of meadows -LRB-especially by sheep who Muir called ``hooved locusts''-RRB-, logging of Giant Sequoia, and other damage, Muir changed from being a promoter and scientist to an advocate for further protection. As part of this new role he persuaded many influential people to accompany him to camp in the park, such as Ralph Waldo Emerson in 1871. On these trips Muir would try to convince his guests of the importance of putting the area under federal protection. None of his guests through the 1880s could do much for Muir's cause except for Robert Underwood Johnson, who was editor of Century Magazine. Through Johnson, Muir had a national audience for his writing and a highly motivated and crafty Congressional lobbyist. His wish was partially answered on October 1, 1890 when the area outside the valley and sequoia grove became a national park under the un-opposed Yosemite Act. The Act withdrew these lands from ``settlement, occupancy, or sale'' and protected ``all timber, mineral deposits, natural curiosities or wonders'' along with prohibiting ``wanton destruction of the fish and game and their capture or destruction for the purposes of merchandise or profit''. This was the first time the federal government set aside land for such a purpose. It is important to note, that Yosemite National Park does include the entire upper drainages of two separate river watersheds -LRB-which was very important to Muir who said ``you cannot save Yosemite Valley without saving its Sierran fountains.''-RRB- The State of California, however, retained control of the Valley and Grove. Muir also helped persuade local officials to virtually eliminate grazing from the Yosemite High Country. A dairy herd was kept in the valley and all horses brought there grazed in its meadows, however. Muir and 181 others founded the Sierra Club in 1892, in part to lobby for the transfer of the Valley and Grove into the National Park. -LSB-edit-RSB- Army administration and a unified national park Like Yellowstone National Park before it, Yosemite was at first administered by the United States Army. Captain Abram Wood led the 4th Cavalry Regiment into the new park on May 19, 1891 and set up camp in Wawona, called Camp A.E. Wood -LRB-now the Wawona Campground-RRB-. Each summer, 150 cavalrymen traveled from the Presidio of San Francisco to patrol the park. A major problem facing the Cavalry were the approximately 100,000 sheep that were illegally led into Yosemite's high meadows by shepherds each year. Lacking the legal authority to arrest the herders, the Cavalry instead escorted the shepherds several days hike away from their flock. This left the sheep vulnerable and thus became an excellent deterrent. By the late 1890s sheep grazing was no longer a problem, but at least one herder continued grazing his sheep in the park into the 1920s. An extensive trail system developed by the Cavalry later formed the basis for the current trails. To mark trails, the cavalrymen blazed capital Ts into trees, a practice continued from that point onward even though none of the originally blazed trees are still standing. Galen Clark retired as the state park's guardian in 1896, leaving the Valley and Grove under ineffective stewardship. Pre-existing problems in the state park worsened and new problems arose, but the Cavalry could only monitor the situation. Long a proponent of creating a unified Yosemite national park, Muir and his Sierra Club continued to lobby the government and influential people for the creation of a unified Yosemite National Park. In an effort to make the remote area more accessible, the Sierra Club began organizing annual trips to Yosemite, starting in 1901 -LRB-a practice that continues to the present day-RRB-. The LeConte Memorial Lodge is a National Historic Landmark built in 1902 as an education center in honor of Joseph LeConte, a University of California geologist who died in Yosemite Valley the year before. Then in May 1903, Theodore Roosevelt�-- who was then President of the United States�-- camped with John Muir near Glacier Point for three days. On that trip, Muir convinced Roosevelt to take control of the Valley and the Grove away from California and give it to the federal government. In 1906 Roosevelt signed a bill that did precisely that, and the Superintendent's headquarters was moved from the Wawona area to Yosemite Valley. In 1905, however, a huge compromise had to be made to get Congressional and State of California approval; the park extent was reduced by more than 500�miles -LRB-800�km-RRB-, excluding much of what is now the Ansel Adams Wilderness. This compromise excluded natural wonders such as Devils Postpile and prime wildlife habitat. Another reduction in the size of the park occurred near Wawona in 1906 and logging started soon afterward in former park-lands. In 1908 acting superintendent Major H. C. Benson said that ``game is on the decrease. Each reduction of the park has cut another portion of the winter resort of game.'' All the boundary changes resulted in a reduction of one third of the park's area. About 12,000�acres -LRB-4,900�ha-RRB- between Tuolumne and Merced big tree groves was added to the park in 1930 through land purchases by the federal government and matching funds provided by John D. Rockefeller. Another 8,765�acres -LRB-3,547�ha-RRB- near Wawona were added in 1932 and the Carl Inn Tract, located near the Rockefeller purchase, was secured in 1937 and 1939. Army administration of the Park ended in 1914 as well as horse-drawn stage service. Two years of minimal civilian stewardship ensued with 15 former cavalry scouts serving as the only rangers. This task was made all the more difficult due to increasing visitation by motorists. Park visitation doubled in 1915 to 31,000 -LRB-the 1915 entrance fee for motorists was $5, more than an average worker made in a day-RRB-. In an attempt to keep up with demand, stage service was briefly renewed but ended for good in 1916. The National Park Service was formed in 1916 and Yosemite was transferred to that agency's jurisdiction with W.B. Lewis as superintendent. Tuolumne Meadows Lodge and Tioga Pass Road, along with campgrounds at Tenaya and Merced lakes, were also completed in 1916. 600 automobiles entered the east side of the Park using Tioga Road that summer. Stephen Mather, the first director of the Park Service, built the ``Ranger's Club'' at his own expense in 1920 to house Yosemite rangers. Mather donated it to the park and it is now maintained as a National Historic Landmark. In 1926 the ``All-Weather Highway'' -LRB-now State Route 140-RRB- opened, ensuring year-long visitation and supplies under normal conditions. The completion of the 0.8�mile -LRB-1.3�km-RRB- long Wawona Tunnel in 1933 was both an engineering marvel and significantly reduced the amount of travel time to the Valley from Wawona without scarring the landscape with a long road cut -LRB-the famous `Tunnel View' is on the Valley side of the tunnel and Inspiration Point is above it-RRB-. A flood, reduced lumber and mining extraction, and greatly increased automobile and bus use forced the Yosemite Valley Railway out of business in 1945. The present day Tioga Road -LRB-part of State Route 120-RRB- across the park was dedicated in 1961. Starting in 1920, the groundwork for interpretive programs and services in national parks was laid in Yosemite by Harold C. Bryant and Loye Holmes, two professors of natural history. The position of park naturalist was created in 1921 with Ansel F. Hall performing that duty for two years. Hall pioneered the idea of having park museums act as public contact centers and general headquarters for interpretive programs�-- a model followed by all later national parks in the United States and widely adapted internationally as well. Chris Jorgenson's former artist's studio was used to house the temporary museum from 1921 to 1926. Yosemite Museum, the first permanent museum in the National Park System, was completed in 1926. -LSB-edit-RSB- The fight over Hetch Hetchy Valley To the north of Yosemite Valley is Hetch Hetchy Valley, which was considered by many, including John Muir, to be comparable in beauty and significance to Yosemite Valley. The earliest Native peoples of Hetch Hetchy were Paiutes. Water rights to Tuolumne River water were first sought by San Francisco in 1901 but were rejected in 1903 by Secretary of the Interior Ethan Allen Hitchcock who felt the application was ``not in keeping with the public interest.'' Devastation of the the city by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake tipped the balance. Rights to Hetch Hetchy were granted to the City of San Francisco in 1908 by Secretary of the Interior James Garfield. Garfield wrote; ``Domestic use is the highest use to which water and available storage basins.... A long and nationally-polarized fight, pitting preservationists like Muir who wanted to leave wild areas wild against conservationists like Gifford Pinchot who wanted to manage wild areas for the betterment of mankind, ensued. Muir, aided by Robert Underwood Johnson and his Sierra Club, wrote ``Dam Hetch Hetchy! As well dam for watertanks the people's cathedrals and churches, for no holier temple has ever been consecrated by the heart of man.'' Pinchot, who was director of the U.S. Forest Service, wrote to his close friend Roosevelt that he believed ``the highest possible use which could be made of it would be to supply pure water to a great center of population.'' Roosevelt reluctantly sided with Pinchot. Roosevelt's successor, Woodrow Wilson signed the Raker Act in law on December 13, 1913, which authorized construction of the O'Shaughnessy Dam. The valley was flooded in 1923 by impounding of the Tuolumne River behind the O'Shaughnessy Dam, forming the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir. The dam supplies 80% of the drinking water, and some cash from electricity sales, to San Francisco. Shortly before Muir died he expressed the hope that ``some compensating good must follow'' from the Raker Act. The fight over the dam strengthened the conservation movement by popularizing it nationally. -LSB-edit-RSB- More recent history The Ahwahnee Hotel, built in 1927 in Yosemite Valley, is a luxury hotel decorated in Native American motifs. It was designed by the architect Gilbert Stanley Underwood who designed lodges at many of the national parks. For many years Ansel Adams produced an annual pageant there, and in World War II it was used as a rehabilitation hospital for soldiers. It is now a National Historic Landmark. Yosemite National Park has had 11 winter floods since 1916 that have caused substantial damage to property. All of these floods took place between November 1 and January 30. The largest floods occurred in 1937, 1950, 1955, and 1997, and were in the range of 22,000 to 25,000 cubic feet -LRB-620 to 700�m³-RRB- per second, as measured at the Pohono Bridge gauging station in Yosemite Valley. After the 1950 flood, all structures in Old Yosemite Village, except for the chapel, were either moved to the Pioneer Yosemite History center in Wawona or demolished in the 1950s and 1960s. Other structures from throughout the park were also moved to the history center. Some structures in the Old Village, such as the historic 1858 Cedar Cottage, then the oldest building in Yosemite Valley, were demolished even though they weren't flooded. Back then little regard was given to historic preservation, the thought being that the ``highest use'' was preserving and restoring natural scenery. Three different protected zones were added adjacent to Yosemite National Park in 1964: These additional protected areas include areas removed from Yosemite National Park just prior to the 1906 Act as well as other public land. A 1964 act of Congress set aside about 94% of the park in a highly protected wilderness area. No roads, motorized vehicles -LRB-except rescue helicopters and other emergency vehicles-RRB-, or any development of any kind beyond trail maintenance are allowed in this area. In 1968 the famous Yosemite Firefall, in which the embers from a bonfire were pushed off of a cliff near Glacier Point to create a spectacular effect, was ended because it drew excessively large crowds. The Firefall was occasionally performed in the 1870s and became a nightly tradition with the founding of Camp Curry. The broader tensions in American society were felt in Yosemite in 1970, when a large number of youths gathered in the park over the summer. Rioting broke out on July 4 in Stoneman Meadow. The visitors attacked rangers with rocks and pulled mounted rangers from their horses. The National Guard was brought in to maintain order. The late 1990s saw the high-profile murder case of Cary Stayner and some serious rock slides; one rockslide originating from the east side of Glacier Point ended near the Happy Isles of the Merced River, creating a debris field larger than several football fields. Tourism dropped a little after those incidents, but soon after returned to previous levels. -LSB-edit-RSB- Human impact Early park guardians took actions, such as draining swamps, that reduced the number and extent of these meadows. In the 1860s there were over 750�acres -LRB-300�ha-RRB- of meadows in the valley compared to 340�acres -LRB-140�ha-RRB- by the end of the 20th century. These modern meadows must be maintained by removing trees and shrubs. Muir and the Sierra Club at first encouraged efforts to increase visitation. Muir wrote that even the ''... frivolous and inappreciative ...'' visitors were on the whole ''... a most hopeful sign of the times, indicating at least the beginning of our return to nature--for going to the mountains is going home.'' The first automobile entered the Valley in 1900, but growth in car traffic did not increase significantly until 1913 when they were first officially allowed to enter. In 1914, 127 cars entered the park. Visitation rapidly swelled with the advent of the automobile. Park visitation increased from 15,154 in 1914 to 35,527 in 1918 and then 461,000 in 1929. Two thirds of a million visited in 1946. Visitation reached 1 million in 1954, 2 million by 1966, 3 million in the 1980s and 4 million in the 1990s. Car use has proportionately increased too. These millions of users have dramatically influenced the local ecosystem. Decades of aggressive fire suppression have been replaced by a fire management program that includes the yearly use of prescribed fires. Fire is especially important to the Giant Sequoia groves, whose seeds cannot germinate without fire-touched soil. In March 1986 the California Department of Fish and Game, the National Park Service, and the U.S. Forest Service reintroduced Bighorn Sheep just east of the park in Lee Vining Canyon. The herd reached a peak of nearly 100 individuals in 1994, but almost 60% of the herd died in the winter of 1994--1995. About 55 bighorns from the herd were counted in the 1996 census. Brown Bears, also called grizzlies, were once the top predators in the region but went locally extinct in the 1920s. The last confirmed kill of a Yosemite grizzly occurred in Wawona in 1895. These animals figured prominently in Miwok mythology, and a sketch of a Yosemite grizzly by Charles Nahl adorns the flag of California. Inevitable losses of cattle, and danger to people, makes the prospect of reintroduction into the park remote. Other predators, such as coyote, fox, lynx, mountain lion, and wolverine were trapped for their firs by rangers to supplement their incomes. This practice continued until 1925 but predator control continued; the state lion hunter killed 43 mountain lions in Yosemite in 1927. Cooper's hawk and sharp-shinned hawk were hunted and have since became locally extinct. The introduction of trout in Yosemite streams and lakes had a negative impact on native frog populations due to tadpole predation. Lakes and streams are no longer stocked in the park. Tule elk, which were near extinction, were housed in a pen in Yosemite before being moved to the Owens Valley in eastern California. Feeding and viewing of American black bears was encouraged by park concessionaires who provided trash for the animals to eat. Bears were a common attraction by the 1930s; In 1929 alone 81 people were treated for bear-related injuries. Troublesome bears were marked with white paint and relocated to other parts of the park. Bear feeding shows were stopped in 1940 but the Park Service continued to kill bears that habitually raided camps; 200 bears were put down between 1960 and 1972. The Park Service now emphasizes education of park visitors about proper storage of food in order to avoid having to relocate and destroy bears. Bighorn sheep, which were driven locally extinct through hunting and disease, have been reintroduced in the eastern part of the park. The Park Service has also prohibited driving and camping in meadows, which was a common practice in the 1910s to 1930s. Cattle and horses no longer freely roam the park. Over one half billion board feet of timber were felled between World War I and 1930, when John D. Rockefeller, Jr. and the federal government bought out the Yosemite Lumber Company. Yet there were still 1300 buildings in the valley and 17�acres -LRB-6.9�ha-RRB- of the valley floor were covered by parking lots in the late 1990s. Plans for reducing the human impact on the park were released by the Park Service in 1980. The General Management Plan specified a reduction of 17% in overnight accommodations, a 68% reduction in staff housing and removal of golf courses and tennis courts by 1990. This goal was not met but flooding in January 1997 destroyed park infrastructure in Yosemite Valley. The Yosemite Valley Plan was later established to implement the General Management Plan and over 250 other actions. ``Yosemite Valley Plan: The Story and the Process''. Many visitors fail to realize the wild aspect of the park, and tend to treat it like a zoo�-- feeding animals, petting them, taking mementos home; this is a dramatic safety issue for the visitors and is also illegal. Squirrels that feed all summer become obese, making them prey for Mountain Lions, which are a safety issue unto themselves. Food left in cars are easy pickings for the local Black Bear populations. Petting Mule Deer risks serious injury -LRB-the only person killed in Yosemite by an animal was killed by a deer-RRB-. The Park Service, in conjunction with businesses and groups in the park, are trying to encourage people to experience and learn about Yosemite. Trails and high use areas are redesigned to reduce impact. A free shuttle bus system has been developed to help relieve summer traffic congestion in the valley. Proposals to exclude cars in the summer that are not registered at a hotel or campsite within the valley have been investigated -LRB-this has already been implemented at other parks, such as Zion National Park in Utah-RRB-. Many agencies in the Park offer educational activities and trips. Ironically, only about 14 square miles -LRB-36�km²-RRB- of the 1,200�mi² of the park are visited by a majority of the people. The LeConte Memorial Lodge is a National Historic Landmark built in 1902 as an education center in honor of Joseph LeConte, a University of California geologist who died in Yosemite Valley the year before.

Emperor Xian had been a political figurehead since 189, with no control over the actions of the various warlords controlling their respective territories. One of the most powerful rulers in northern China was the warlord Cao Cao, who, by the year 207, had unified northern China and retained total control of the North China Plain. He then completed a successful campaign against the Wuhuan in the winter of the same year, thus securing his northern frontier. Upon his return in 208, he was proclaimed to be the Imperial Chancellor of Han, a position that granted him absolute authority over the entire imperial government -LRB-de Crespigny 1969:253, 465 6n-RRB-. Shortly afterwards, in the autumn of 208, his army began a Southern Campaign -LRB-Eikenberry 1994; de Crespigny 2003-RRB-. The Yangtze River in the area of Jing province -LRB-which roughly corresponded to modern Hubei and Hunan provinces-RRB- was key to the success of this strategy. If Cao Cao were to have any hope of reuniting the sundered Han empire, he had to achieve naval control of the middle Yangtze and command the strategic naval base at Jiangling as a means of access to the southern region -LRB-de Crespigny 2003-RRB-. Two warlords controlled the regions of the Yangtze that were key to Cao Cao's success: Liu Biao, Governor of Jing Province, controlled the river west of the mouth of the Han, roughly encompassing the area around the city of Xiakou and all territory south of that region. Sun Quan controlled the river east of the Han and the southeastern territories abutting it -LRB-de Crespigny 2007:773-RRB-. A third ally, Liu Bei, was living in refuge with Liu Biao at the garrison in Fancheng -LRB-modern Xiangfan-RRB-, having fled from the northeast to the Jing Province following a failed plot to assassinate Cao Cao and restore power to the imperial dynasty -LRB-de Crespigny 2007:480; de Crespigny 1969:258-RRB-. The initial stages of the campaign were an unqualified success for Cao Cao, as the command of the Jing Province had been substantially weakened and the Jing armies exhausted by conflict with Sun Quan to the south -LRB-de Crespigny 2007:486-RRB-. Factions had arisen supporting either of Liu Biao's two sons in a struggle for succession. The younger son prevailed, and Liu Biao's dispossessed eldest son, Liu Qi, departed to assume a commandery in Jiangxia -LRB-de Crespigny 2004:241-RRB-. Liu Biao died of illness only a few weeks later, while Cao Cao was advancing from the north and, under these circumstances, Liu Biao's younger son and successor, Liu Cong, quickly surrendered. Cao Cao thus captured a sizeable fleet and secured the naval base at Jiangling. This provided him with a key strategic military depot and forward base to harbour his ships -LRB-de Crespigny 2004:246,250,255-RRB-. When Jing fell, Liu Bei quickly fled south, accompanied by a refugee population of civilians and soldiers. This disorganised exodus was pursued by Cao Cao's elite cavalry, and was surrounded and decisively beaten at the Battle of Changban -LRB-near the modern-day city of Dangyang in Hubei-RRB-. Liu Bei escaped, however, and fled further east to Xiakou, where he liaised with Sun Quan's emissary Lu Su. At this point historical accounts are inconsistent; Lu Su may have successfully encouraged Liu Bei to move even further east, to Fankou -LRB-樊口-RRB-. In either case, Liu Bei was later joined by Liu Qi and levies from Jiangxia -LRB-de Crespigny 2004:255-RRB-. Liu Bei's main advisor, Zhuge Liang, was sent to Chaisang -LRB-柴桑-RRB- to negotiate forming a mutual front against Cao Cao with the state of Wu -LRB-de Crespigny 1969:263-RRB-. By the time Zhuge Liang arrived, Cao Cao had already sent Sun Quan a letter boasting of commanding 800,000 men and demanding Sun Quan's surrender. The faction led by Sun Quan's Chief Clerk, Zhang Zhao, advocated surrender, citing Cao Cao's overwhelming numerical advantage. However, on separate occasions, Lu Su, Zhuge Liang, and Wu's chief commander, Zhou Yu, all presented arguments to persuade Sun Quan to agree to the alliance against the northerners. Sun Quan finally decided upon war, chopping off a corner of his desk during an assembly and stating: ``Anyone who still dares argue for surrender will be -LSB-treated-RSB- the same as this desk.'' He then assigned Zhou Yu, Cheng Pu, and Lu Su with 30,000 men to aid Liu Bei against Cao Cao -LRB-de Crespigny 1996-RRB-. Although Cao Cao had boasted command of 800,000 men, Zhou Yu estimated Cao Cao's actual troop strength to be closer to 220,000. Furthermore, this total included 70,000 impressed troops from the armies of the recently defeated Liu Biao, so the loyalty and morale of a large number of Cao Cao's force was uncertain -LRB-Eikenberry 1994:60-RRB-. With the 20,000 soldiers that Liu Bei had gathered, the alliance consisted of approximately 50,000 marines who were trained and prepared for battle -LRB-de Crespigny 2004:252;255-RRB-. -LSB-edit-RSB- Battle The Battle of Red Cliffs unfolded in three stages: an initial skirmish at Red Cliffs followed by a retreat to the Wulin battlefields on the northwestern bank of the Yangtze, a decisive naval engagement, and Cao Cao's disastrous retreat along Huarong Road. The combined Sun-Liu force sailed upstream from either Xiakou or Fankou to Red Cliffs, where they encountered Cao Cao's vanguard force. Plagued by disease and low morale due to the series of forced marches they had undertaken on the prolonged Southern Campaign -LRB-de Crespigny 2003-RRB-, Cao Cao's men could not gain an advantage in the small skirmish which ensued, so Cao Cao retreated to Wulin -LRB-north of the Yangtze River-RRB- and the allies pulled back to the south -LRB-de Crespigny 2004:257-RRB-. Cao Cao had moored his ships from stem to stern, possibly aiming to reduce seasickness in his navy, which comprised mostly northerners who were not used to living on ships. Observing this, divisional commander Huang Gai sent Cao Cao a letter feigning surrender and prepared a squadron of capital ships described as mengchong doujian -LRB-蒙衝鬥艦-RRB-. The ships had been converted into fire ships by filling them with bundles of kindling, dry reeds, and fatty oil. As Huang Gai's ``defecting'' squadron approached the midpoint of the river, the sailors applied fire to the ships before taking to small boats. The unmanned fire ships, carried by the southeastern wind, sped towards Cao Cao's fleet and set it ablaze. Within a short time smoke and flames stretched across the sky, and a large number of men and horses either burned to death or drowned -LRB-Chen c. 280:54.1262-63-RRB-. Following the initial shock, Zhou Yu and the allies led a lightly armed force to capitalise on the assault. The northern army was thrown into confusion and was utterly smashed. Seeing the situation was hopeless, Cao Cao then issued a general order of retreat and destroyed a number of his remaining ships before withdrawing -LRB-Chen c. 280-RRB-. Cao Cao's army attempted a retreat along Huarong Road, including a long stretch passing through marshlands north of Dongting Lake. Heavy rains had reduced the track to a thick mire, making the road so treacherous that many of the sick soldiers had to carry bundles of grass on their backs and use them to fill the road, to allow the horsemen to cross. Many of these soldiers drowned in the mud or were trampled to death in the effort. To the misery of Cao Cao's army, the allies, led by Zhou Yu and Liu Bei, gave chase over land and water until they reached Nan Commandery -LRB-南郡-RRB-. Combined with famine and disease, this decimated Cao Cao's remaining forces. Cao Cao then retreated north to his home base of Ye, leaving Cao Ren and Xu Huang to guard Jiangling, Yue Jin stationed in Xiangyang, and Man Chong in Dangyang -LRB-Chen c. 280-RRB-. The allied counterattack might have vanquished Cao Cao and his forces entirely. However, the crossing of the Yangtze River dissolved into chaos as the allied armies converged on the riverbank and fought over the limited number of ferries. To restore order, a detachment led by the allied general Gan Ning established a bridgehead in Yiling to the north, and only a staunch rearguard action by Cao Ren prevented further catastrophe -LRB-Eikenberry 1994:60; de Crespigny 2007:239-RRB-. -LSB-edit-RSB- Analysis A combination of Cao Cao's strategic errors and the effectiveness of Huang Gai's ruse had resulted in the allied victory at the Battle of Red Cliffs. Zhou Yu had previously observed that Cao Cao's generals and soldiers comprised mostly cavalry and infantry, and few had any experience in naval warfare. Cao Cao also had little support among the people of Jing province, and thus lacked a secure forward base of operations -LRB-Eikenberry 1994:60-RRB-. Despite the strategic acumen Cao Cao had displayed in earlier campaigns and battles, in this case he had simply assumed that numerical superiority would eventually defeat the Sun and Liu navy. Cao's first tactical mistake was converting his massive army of infantry and cavalry into a marine corps and navy: with only a few days of drills before the battle, Cao Cao's troops were ravaged by sea-sickness and lack of experience on water. Tropical diseases, to which the southerners had long been immune, also plagued the soldiers of the north with the debilitating effects of sickness rampant in Cao Cao's camps. Although numerous, Cao Cao's men were already exhausted by the unfamiliar environment and the extended southern campaign, as Zhuge Liang observed: ``Even a powerful arrow at the end of its flight cannot penetrate a silk cloth'' -LRB-Military Documents 1979:193-RRB-. The uncharacteristically poor preparation and miscalculations displayed by Cao Cao during this campaign may have been partly due to the recent death of his strategist and advisor Guo Jia. Cao Cao himself had commented: ``Had Guo Jia been with us, I would never have got into such trouble'' -LRB-Chen c. 280:14:433-RRB-. Another key advisor, Jia Xu, had recommended after the surrender of Liu Cong that the overtaxed armies be given time to rest and replenish before engaging the armies of Sun Quan and Liu Bei, but Cao Cao disregarded the advice -LRB-Eikenberry 1994:60-RRB-. Cao Cao's own thoughts regarding his failure at Red Cliffs suggest that he held his own actions and misfortunes responsible for the defeat, rather than the strategies utilised by his enemy during the battle: ''...it was only because of the sickness that I burnt my ships and retreated. It is out of all reason for Zhou Yu to take the credit for himself.'' -LSB-edit-RSB- Aftermath By the end of 209, the post Cao Cao had established at Jiangling fell to Zhou Yu. The borders of the land under Cao Cao's control contracted about 160�kilometres -LRB-100�miles-RRB-, to the area around Xiangyang -LRB-de Crespigny 2004:291-RRB-. Liu Bei, on the other hand, had gained territory by taking over the four commanderies south of the Yangtze River. Sun Quan's troops had suffered far greater casualties than Liu Bei's in the extended conflict against Cao Ren following the Battle of Red Cliffs -LRB-de Crespigny 2004:291--292-RRB-, and the death of Zhou Yu in 210 resulted in a drastic weakening of Sun Quan's strength in the Jing province -LRB-de Crespigny 2004:297-RRB-. Liu Bei also occupied the Jing province that Cao Cao had recently lost--a strategic and naturally fortified area on the Yangtze River that Wu claimed for itself. The control of Jing provided Liu Bei with virtually unlimited access to the passage into Shu and important waterways into Wu, as well as dominion of the southern Yangtze River. Never again would Cao Cao command so large a fleet as he had at Jiangling, nor would a similar opportunity to destroy his southern rivals present itself again -LRB-de Crespigny 2007:37-RRB-. The Battle of Red Cliffs and the capture of Jing province by Liu Bei confirmed the separation of Southern China from the northern heartland of the Yellow River valley, and also foreshadowed a north-south axis of hostility which would resonate for centuries -LRB-de Crespigny 2004:260-RRB-. -LSB-edit-RSB- Location The precise location of the Red Cliffs battlefield has long been the subject of both popular and academic debates, but has never been conclusively established. Scholarly debates have continued for at least 1,350 years -LRB-Zhang 2006:215-RRB-, and a number of arguments in favour of alternative sites have been put forward. There are clear grounds for rejecting at least some of these proposals, but four alternative locations are still advocated. According to Zhang -LRB-2006-RRB-, many of the current debates stem from the fact that the course and length of the Yangtze River between Wuli and Wuhan has changed since the Sui and Tang dynasties -LRB-Zhang 2006:225-RRB-. The modern-day debate is also complicated by the fact that the names of some of the key locations have changed over the following centuries. For example, although modern Huarong city is located in Hunan, south of the Yangtze, in the 3rd century the city of that name was due east of Jiangling, considerably north of the Yangtze -LRB-Zhang 2006:229; de Crespigny 2004:256 78n-RRB-. Moreover, one candidate site, Puqi -LRB-蒲圻-RRB-, was renamed ``Chibi City'' -LRB-赤壁市-RRB- in 1998 in a direct attempt to tie this location to the historical battlefield. Historical records state that Cao Cao's forces retreated north across the Yangtze after the initial engagement at Red Cliffs, unequivocally placing the battle site on the south bank of the Yangtze. For this reason, a number of sites on the north bank have been discounted by historians and geographers. Historical accounts also establish east and west boundaries for a stretch of the Yangtze which encompasses all possible sites for the battlefield. The allied forces travelled upstream from either Fankou or Xiakou. Since the Yangtze flows roughly eastward towards the ocean -LRB-with northeast and southeast meanders-RRB-, Red Cliffs must at least be west of Fankou, which is farther downstream. The westernmost boundary is also clear, since Cao Cao's eastern advance from Jiangling included passing Baqiu -LRB-modern Yueyang city in Hunan province-RRB- on the shore of Dongting Lake. The battle must also have been downstream -LRB-northeast-RRB- of that location -LRB-de Crespigny 2004:256--257; Zhang 2006:217-RRB-. One popular candidate for the battle site is Chibi Hill in Huangzhou, sometimes referred to as ``Su Dongpo's Red Cliffs'' or the ``Literary Red Cliffs'' -LRB-文赤壁-RRB-. Support for this conjecture arises largely due to the famous 11th-century poem ``First Rhapsody on the Red Cliffs,'' which equates the Huangzhou Hill with the battlefield location. The pinyin Romanization of this cliff's name is ``Chibi'', the same as the pinyin for Red Cliffs. However, the Chinese characters are completely different -LRB-赤鼻-RRB- as is their meaning -LRB-``Red Nose Hill''-RRB-. This site is also on the north bank of the Yangtze, and is directly across from Fankou rather than upstream from it -LRB-Zhang 2006:215-RRB-. Moreover, if the allied Sun/Liu forces left from Xiakou rather than Fankou, as the oldest historical sources suggest, then the hill in Huangzhou would have been downstream from the point of departure, a possibility which cannot be reconciled with historical sources. Puqi, now named Chibi City, is perhaps the most widely accepted candidate. To differentiate from Su Dongpo's Red Cliffs, the site is also referred to as the ``Military Red Cliffs'' -LRB-武赤壁-RRB-. It is directly across the Yangtze from Wulin. This argument was first proposed in the early Tang Dynasty -LRB-Zhang 2006:217-RRB-. There are also characters engraved in the cliffs -LRB-see image at the top of this page-RRB- suggesting that this is the site of the battle. The origin of the engraving can be dated to between the Tang and Song dynasties, making it at least 1,000 years old -LRB-Zhang 2006:219;228-RRB-. Some sources mention the south banks of the Yangtze in Jiayu County -LRB-嘉鱼县-RRB- in the prefecture-level city of Xianning in Hubei province as a possible location. This would place the battlefield downstream from Puqi -LRB-Chibi City-RRB-, a view that is supported by scholars of Chinese history such as Rafe de Crespigny, Wang Li and Zhu Dongrun, following the Qing Dynasty historical document Shui Jing Zhu -LRB-de Crespigny 2004:256-RRB-. Another candidate is Wuhan, which straddles the Yangtze at the confluence of the Yangtze and Han rivers. It is east of both Wulin -LRB-and Chibi City across the river-RRB- and Jiayu. This metropolis was incorporated by joining three cities. There is a local belief in Wuhan that the battle was fought at the junction of the rivers, southwest of the former Wuchang city, which is now part of Wuhan -LRB-de Crespigny 2004:256 n 78-RRB-. Zhang -LRB-2006:215;223-RRB- asserts that the Chibi battlefield was one of a set of hills in Wuchang that were levelled in the 1930s so that their stone could be used as raw material. Citing several historical-geographical studies, Zhang -LRB-2006-RRB- shows that earlier accounts place the battlefield in Wuchang. Sheng Honzhi's 5th-century Jingzhou ji in particular places the Chibi battlefield a distance of 160�li -LRB-approximately 80�kilometres -LRB-50�mi-RRB--RRB- downstream from Wulin, but since the Paizhou and Luxikou meanders increased the length of the Yangtze River between Wuli and Wuchang by 100�li -LRB-approximately 50�kilometres -LRB-31�mi-RRB-; see map-RRB- some time in the Sui and Tang dynasties -LRB-Zhang 2006:225-RRB-, later works do not regard Wuchang as a possible site. -LSB-edit-RSB- Fictionalised account The romantic tradition that originated with the Romance of the Three Kingdoms differs from historical accounts in many details. For example, Cao Cao's army strength was exaggerated to over 800,000 men. This may be attributed to the ethos of later times, particularly of the Southern Song Dynasty -LRB-de Crespigny 2007:483-RRB-. The Shu kingdom in particular was viewed by later literati as the ``legitimate'' successor to the Han empire, so fictionalised accounts assign greater prominence than the historical records warrant to the roles of Liu Bei, Zhuge Liang and other heroes from Shu. This is generally accomplished by minimising the importance of Wu commanders and advisors such as Zhou Yu and Lu Su -LRB-de Crespigny 2004:xi-RRB-. While historical accounts describe Lu Su as a sensible advisor and Zhou Yu as an eminent military leader and ``generous, sensible and courageous'' man, the Romance of the Three Kingdoms depicts Lu Su as unremarkable and Zhou Yu as cruel and cynical -LRB-de Crespigny 2004:300; 305--306 29n-RRB-. Both are depicted as being inferior to Zhuge Liang in every respect -LRB-de Crespigny 2004:264-RRB-. The romances added wholly fictional and fantastical elements to the historical accounts and these were repeated in popular plays and operas. Examples from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms include Zhuge Liang using magic to call forth favourable winds for the fire ship attack, his strategy of ``using straw boats to borrow arrows'', and Guan Yu capturing and releasing Cao Cao at Huarong Trail. The fictionalised accounts also name Zhuge Liang as a military commander in the combined forces, which is not historically accurate -LRB-de Crespigny 2004:260-264-RRB-. -LSB-edit-RSB- Modern and cultural impact Modern day Chibi City in Hubei province was formerly named Puqi. In 1998, the Chinese State Council approved the renaming of the city in celebration of the battle at Red Cliffs. Cultural festivals held by the city have dramatically increased tourism. In 1983, a statue of prominent Song Dynasty poet, Su Shi, was erected at the Huangzhou site of `Su Dongpo's Red Cliffs' in tribute to his writings regarding Red Cliff -LRB-Xinhua 1983-RRB-. Popular video games based around the Three Kingdoms era -LRB-such as the Dynasty Warriors series, Sangokushi Koumeiden, Destiny of an Emperor and Kessen II-RRB- have scenarios that include the battle. Other games utilise the Battle of Red Cliffs as their central focus. These include titles popular in Asia, such as the original Japanese version of Warriors of Fate and Dragon Throne: Battle of Red Cliffs. A 2008 film, directed by John Woo and titled Red Cliff, was intended to showcase the Red Cliff legacy and became a massive box-office success in China. -LSB-edit-RSB- Battle The Battle of Red Cliffs unfolded in three stages: an initial skirmish at Red Cliffs followed by a retreat to the Wulin battlefields on the northwestern bank of the Yangtze, a decisive naval engagement, and Cao Cao's disastrous retreat along Huarong Road. -LSB-edit-RSB- Battle The Battle of Red Cliffs unfolded in three stages: an initial skirmish at Red Cliffs followed by a retreat to the Wulin battlefields on the northwestern bank of the Yangtze, a decisive naval engagement, and Cao Cao's disastrous retreat along Huarong Road. -LSB-edit-RSB- Battle The Battle of Red Cliffs unfolded in three stages: an initial skirmish at Red Cliffs followed by a retreat to the Wulin battlefields on the northwestern bank of the Yangtze, a decisive naval engagement, and Cao Cao's disastrous retreat along Huarong Road. -LSB-edit-RSB- Battle The Battle of Red Cliffs unfolded in three stages: an initial skirmish at Red Cliffs followed by a retreat to the Wulin battlefields on the northwestern bank of the Yangtze, a decisive naval engagement, and Cao Cao's disastrous retreat along Huarong Road.

The gameplay style is a mix of action, platform, and puzzle gaming genres, and has been noted by many reviewers to have numerous similarities in overall gameplay style to The Legend of Zelda series, an inspiration that director Hideki Kamiya, a self-proclaimed Zelda-fan, has admitted has influenced his general game design. The main story is primarily linear, directed through by Amaterasu's guide Issun, though numerous side quests and optional activities allow for players to explore the game world and take the story at their own pace. By completing quests, side quests and small additional activities -LRB-such as making trees bloom into life or feeding wild animals-RRB-, Amaterasu earns Praise, which can then be spent to increase various statistics of the character, such as the amount of health and number of ink wells for Celestial Brush techniques. Combat is staged in a ghostly virtual arena, and Amaterasu can fight enemies using a combination of weapons, fighting techniques and Brush methods to dispatch the foes. At the end of combat, money -LRB-as yen-RRB- is rewarded to Amaterasu, with bonuses for completing a battle quickly and without taking damage. The money can be spent on numerous items from merchants across the land, including healing goods, better weapons, tools and key items for completing quests. The money can also be used to buy new combat techniques at dojos throughout the land. Additionally, rare Demon Fangs can be earned through combat which can be traded for additional, unique items that are beneficial in gameplay but not required to complete the game. Weapons inspired by the Imperial Regalia of Japan, the Reflector, the Rosaries and the Glaive can be equipped on Amaterasu as either a main or sub-weapon, and used in addition to other melee attacks that the player can have Amaterasu learn through the course of the game. -LSB-edit-RSB- Celestial Brush Unique to Ōkami is the Celestial Brush. Players can bring the game to a pause and call up a canvas, where the player can draw onto the screen, either using the left analog stick on the PlayStation 2's DualShock controller or pointing with the Wii Remote. This feature is used in combat, puzzles and as general gameplay. For example, the player can create strong wind by drawing a loop, cut enemies by drawing a line through them or create bridges by painting one, amongst many other abilities. These techniques are learned through the course of the game by completing constellations to release the Celestial Brush gods -LRB-inspired by the Chinese zodiac-RRB- from their hiding spots. It is also possible to upgrade or modify certain Brush powers later in the game. For example, the Celestial Brush power Inferno can gain a new power called Fireburst, which has a different drawing pattern, and allows players to create flames without relying on torches or other related items. The player's ink for drawing is limited by the amount available in special ink wells, preventing the player from solely using Brush techniques to defeat enemies; ink is restored in the wells over time when the Brush is not used. -LSB-edit-RSB- Plot -LRB-Note: Most character names below are the shortened names of the U.S. version.-RRB- -LSB-edit-RSB- Story The game is set in Nippon based on Japanese classic history, and begins with a flashback to events 100 years prior to the game's present, and describes how Shiranui, a pure white wolf, and Nagi, a swordsman, together fought the eight-headed demon Orochi to save Kamiki Village and the maiden Nami, Nagi's beloved. Shiranui and Nagi are unable to defeat Orochi but manage to seal the demon away. In the game's present, Susano, a descendant of Nagi and self-proclaimed greatest warrior, breaks Orochi's seal due to the fact that he does not believe in the legend, and Orochi escapes and curses the lands, sapping the life from every living being. Sakuya, the wood sprite and guardian of Kamiki Village, calls forth Amaterasu, the sun goddess, known to the villagers as the reincarnation of the white wolf Shiranui, and pleads her to remove the curse that covers the land. Accompanied by the artist Issun -LRB-an inch-high Poncle-RRB-, Amaterasu is able to restore the land to its former beauty. Throughout the journey, Amaterasu is hounded by Waka, a strange but powerful individual that seems to have the gift of foresight, and further teases Amaterasu and Issun to his own mysterious ends. Additionally, Amaterasu locates several Celestial Gods who have hidden in the constellations that bestow upon the goddess powers of the Celestial Brush to aid in her quest. Soon, Amaterasu, along with Susano, must battle Orochi to protect Kamiki Village and rescue Susano's beloved, Kushi, recreating events from 100 years prior. This time, the duo are able to fully conquer the demon, causing a black, evil spirit to float northward. Amaterasu and Issun then embark on a journey across Nippon and continue to remove Orochi's curse on the land through defeating other demons that release similar dark presences floating northward. As Amaterasu travels to find the source of these evil spirits, she is brought to the wreckage of a ship able to travel through the stars: the ``Ark of Yamato''. Waka appears and reveals himself as a member of the Moon Tribe, a race that had supplied the Ark of Yamato to the Celestial Beings, who used it to escape from Orochi's assault on the Celestial Plain and sail the heavens, unaware of the evil spirits imprisoned on the Ark which attacked and killed all but himself, resulting in the Ark crashing to earth. Amaterasu defeats Yami, the demon controlling all the evil spirits, and rids both the Ark and Nippon of these evil beings forever. With her mission done, Amaterasu departs with Waka on the Ark to sail back to the Celestial Plain together. -LSB-edit-RSB- Characters The player controls Ōkami Amaterasu, the goddess of the sun, in the form of a white wolf. While Amaterasu is referred to in the Japanese and European version of the game as a female, the North American version never states Amaterasu as a specific sex. Some characters, however, will refer to Amaterasu in either a feminine or masculine method, but neither are shown to be correct nor incorrect. While Amaterasu, when endowed with ink power, is seen by the player with red markings, cloud-like fur on her shoulders, and weapons on her back, most of the human characters in the game only see her as a plain white wolf; some believe Amaterasu to be the reincarnation of Shiranui -LRB-the white wolf that fought Orochi 100 years prior to the game's present-RRB-, and do not recognize her spiritual nature. If the player depletes their power by overuse of the celestial brush, Amaterasu will temporarily revert to this mundane white form. Issun, an arrogant, inch-tall ``wandering artist'' seeking out the 13 Celestial Brush techniques for himself, accompanies Amaterasu -LRB-whom he calls ``Ammy'' or ``furball''-RRB- and serves as a guide, dialog proxy, and as comic relief He grows in character along with Ammy throughout the game, eventually becoming her true friend, inspiration, and eventually her savior. While there is not a main singular antagonist within the game, two characters reappear several times within the quest. Waka appears as a young flute-playing man to Amaterasu several times in the game, aware of the goddess's form of the white wolf and foretelling of her future and at times battling with her; his dialogue, dropping French affectionate terms at times, conveys a sense of familiarity with Amaterasu, as it turns out that Waka is much older than he appears and has walked with Amaterasu on the Celestial Plain hundreds of years ago. The other is Orochi, the eight-headed demon and a major villain within the game which the player will encounter several times. Orochi repeatedly has threatened Kamiki village, demanding a sacrifice of a young woman. Each of its eight heads is infused with a different elemental magic power, but the entire demon is susceptible to a special brew of sake available only at Kamiki Village, allowing Amaterasu to defeat it while in its stupor. Throughout the game, the player encounters several other characters that are inspired from Japanese folklore. -LSB-edit-RSB- Development Ōkami resulted from the combined ideas of Clover Studio. The game was originally built around ``depict-LSB-ing-RSB- a lot of nature'', but had no central concept or theme, according to lead designer Hideki Kamiya. Kamiya eventually created a minute-long demonstration movie showing a wolf running about a forest, with flowers blossoming in its wake, but still lacked any gameplay. Kamiya and other members of the team introduced ideas around the nature aspect and eventually led to the game's initial prototype, which Kamiya admitted was ``incredibly boring to play''. Kamiya suggested that he allowed so many ideas from the team that resulted in the development moving off-target, including creating more of a simulation. Eventually, they settled onto the gameplay found in the final product. The art in Ōkami is highly inspired by Japanese watercolor and wood carving art of the Ukiyo-e style, such as the work of Hokusai. Ōkami was originally planned to be rendered in a more photorealistic 3D style. However, Clover Studio determined that the more colorful sumi-e style allowed them to better convey Amaterasu's association with nature and the task of restoring it. The change was also influenced by limitations in the PS2 hardware to render the photorealistic 3D graphics. As a result of the switch to the watercolor style, the idea of the Celestial Brush came about. Atsushi Inaba, CEO of Clover, noted that ``Once we fixed ourselves on a graphical style and got down to the brushwork, we thought `Wouldn't it be great if we could somehow get the player involved and participate in this artwork instead of just watching it?' That's how the idea of the Celestial Brush was born''. Original concepts for enemies included the use of dinosaurs, but the designs settled onto more demon-like characters. Amaterasu's initial designs were aimed to avoid having the character look like ``your pet wearing clothing''. The developers had considered having Amaterasu change into a dolphin when in the water and a falcon when jumping off a cliff, but dropped these ideas. Sakuya, designed around a peach motif, was envisioned with what were called ``level 2'' and ``level 3'' designs where the character would wear less clothing as the story progressed, but the ``level 3'' appearance, effectively naked, was vetoed by Inaba. Waka's character was aimed to be a Tatsunoko-like character, with the hood designed to be reminiscent of those worn by the Gatchaman. Orochi in Japanese mythology is a gigantic creature, so lead character designer Takeyasu Sawaki designed the back of the demon to include a garden and palace; this inspired the game designers to include a bell in those structures that would be Orochi's fatal weakness in the game. The localization team had to translate 1500 pages of text to make sure it made sense in a ``native check'', due to lack of plurals in the Japanese language and the large number of characters and conditional conversations that the player could interact with. The team recognized that certain elements of the game would not be recognized by Western audiences, but left enough text and details to allow the players to look up the information for themselves. Only one puzzle in the game had to be changed as it required knowledge of the steps in drawing a kanji character which would be readily known for Japanese audiences; for the Western release, these steps were demonstrated in the game. The team noted that personalities of characters could be easily conveyed in Japanese text simply by the way sentences were constructed or slurred, a feature that could not directly be applied to localization. Instead, working with Kamiya, the team scripted the localization to either recreate the personality to match the Japanese version, or to create a whole new set of mannerisms for the characters as appropriate. Ōkami was shown at the 2005 E3 Convention, approximately 30% complete, with a planned release in 2006. At this point, the game had much of the core gameplay, including the Celestial Brush and the combat system in place. The game was released a year later in 2006. However, just a few weeks following its release in North America to strong critical reception, Capcom announced the closure of Clover Studio. The Ōkami: Official Complete Works art book was published by Udon in May 2008. The game was re-released under Sony's ``Greatest Hits'' in Japan in August 2008. -LSB-edit-RSB- Naming and allusions The title of the game is a pun; the word ōkami -LRB-狼-RRB- in Japanese means ``wolf''. However, the kanji characters used as the title of this game -LRB-大神-RRB-, pronounced identically, mean ``great deity'', so the main character is a great wolf deity. The same characters -LRB-大神-RRB- are also used to write the full name of the sun goddess Amaterasu Ōmikami. The localization team opted to use shorter versions of Japanese names -LRB-for example, a boy named ``Mushikai'' was localized as ``Mushi''-RRB- instead of replacing the names with Western-style ones. Issun's informal name for Amaterasu in the Western translation, ``Ammy'', was inspired by Kamiya, and is similar in tone with the Japanese informal name, ``Ammako''. Throughout the game, Ōkami includes several references -LRB-in visual effects, animation, or dialogue-RRB- to other Capcom titles such as Viewtiful Joe, which Clover Studios also developed. For example, Mrs. Orange's technique for making cherry cake parodies Street Fighter's Akuma's Shun Goku Satsu, complete with a kanji word displayed on screen with her back facing the screen. -LSB-edit-RSB- Audio All of the music in Ōkami is original and inspired by classical Japanese works. The final song, played over the credit sequence, ``Reset'', is sung by Ayaka Hirahara. Capcom has released an official 5-disc soundtrack for Ōkami, which is available exclusively in the Japanese market. In the US and European release, the player can unlock a jukebox to hear the in-game music upon completion of the game. At the 2008 BAFTA Video Games Awards Ōkami won Best Score. Suleputer has also published another album, a piano arrangement, entitled Ōkami Piano Arrange. It was released on 30 March 2007. Mika Matsūra both arranged the 10 songs, and performed it on the piano. The characters' speech in the game is actually created by scrambling samples of voice actors' speech, with more emotional lines being created from voice work given in that emotion. -LSB-edit-RSB- Wii version The gameplay function of ``drawing'' or ``painting'' strokes on the screen led several journalists and gamers alike to believe that Ōkami would be well-suited for the Nintendo DS or Wii, both of which feature controls capable of creating drawing motions freely. After the game's release, industry rumors of the game being ported to either console persisted, despite Atsushi Inaba of Clover Studio feeling that Ōkami's action-based gameplay would not translate well to the console and statements from Capcom that there were ``no plans for Ōkami on Wii''. However, at the 2007 UK Gamers Day, Capcom announced that Ready at Dawn would oversee porting and development of a Wii version of Ōkami originally scheduled for release in March 2008 but subsequently pushed back to April 2008. Christian Svensson, Capcom's Vice-President of Strategic Planning and Business Development, stated that Capcom had received numerous requests from fans for the development of the Wii version, and that the ported game ``specifically exists because of that direct communication, especially those we receive on our message boards -LRB-even if they're sometimes mean to us-RRB-.'' Ready at Dawn president Didier Malenfant has stated that, aside from the control scheme, the Wii version will be ``an exact port of the PS2 version.'' The lack of enhancements for the game caused several complaints from gamers, to which Svensson addressed, stating that Svensson reported that the original game assets given to them from Capcom Japan were incomplete, and even after requesting old hard drives and computers to recover more assets, Ready at Dawn was still required to recreate some from scratch. Furthermore, the game had to be recoded to change optimizations that were made for the PlayStation 2 version; Svensson stated that ``part of the reason we didn't show it until we started showing it was because, if we showed it in a form that was anything less than near-perfect, people were going to freak out''. On 15 November 2007, Svensson noted that the engine had been ported to the Wii, writing that ``There are still several systems getting set up properly but there's most definitely a Wii-driven Amaterasu running around Wii-rendered environments as we speak.'' A listing posted at Capcom's website for the game on 15 February 2008 revealed that the Wii version would support 480p and widescreen output, and IGN confirmed that the motion sensing of the Wii Remote would be used to perform the Celestial Brush features within the game. IGN's hands-on also cited small changes to the game such as additional motion-sensing controls using both the Wii Remote and Nunchuck attachment, and the ability to skip cutscenes, but reported no other changes in content of the game. Svennson noted that Capcom would not use television advertising for Ōkami on the Wii, but would use online marketing, including art contests and a new website with ``all sorts of things for fans to use to make stuff''. This site was made live on 3 April 2008, featuring wallpapers, character artwork and fan-created art for the game. Svennson further noted that ``If -LSB-Ōkami for the Wii-RSB- did the numbers that we did on the PS2, I'd be very happy. This doesn't need to be a mainstream success for this to be a success for the company.'' A ``paper parchment'' filter applied to all on-screen elements that was readily apparent in the PlayStation 2 version was still included in the Wii port, but the effect was made much less significant. To help with drawing with the Celestial Brush, two different buttons on the Wii controllers were given brush functionality; one button was assigned to provide free-form strokes, while the other was set to draw a straight line from the starting point. The final credits movie that was in the PlayStation 2 version of the game was removed from the Wii version, much to Kamiya's regret as it removed the omoi--``a combination of thoughts, emotions, and messages'' -- from the game: ''-LSB-The staff roll was-RSB- the omoi of everyone who worked on the project, put together in a moment of bliss held out just for those who completed the journey. It was a special staff roll for a special moment. And now it is gone. ...It's incredibly disappointing and sad.'' A Capcom representative noted that the credits, a pre-rendered movie, had the Clover Studio logo within it, and they had ``no legal right to use the Clover logo in a game they were not involved with directly''. Since they also lacked the source to the credits, they opted to remove them entirely from the game. Ready at Dawn's co-founder Didier Malenfant stated that the Wii version of Ōkami took up much more space on the game media than the PlayStation 2 version, and that the movie was cut in order to fit everything on a single game disk. The credit sequence was restored in the Japanese release of the Wii version. Players have discovered that the cover of the North American Wii version of Ōkami includes a watermark from IGN, and traced the source to an image taken from IGN's site. To make up for the error, Capcom offered for a limited time to replace the cover with one of three high-resolution covers free of charge to users in North America. Due to delays in fulfilling the offer, Capcom shipped copies of all three covers to those that registered. They have since discontinued the offer, but have made the cover images available worldwide in high-quality PDF files for users to download and print themselves. The European PAL version of the cover has no such error. -LSB-edit-RSB- Sequel Sales of Ōkami were considered poor for justifying a sequel; in July 2008, in response to users' questions on the possibility of a sequel, Svensson stated that ``I think we need a lot more people buying the current version before we seriously consider a sequel''. However, after the appearance of a Japanese trademark by Capcom on the word ``Ōkamiden'' a few months before the Wii version of Ōkami in Japan, many speculated that a sequel was pending. The September 2009 issue of Famitsu announced that Ōkamiden: Chīsaki Taiyō -LRB-大神伝～小さき太陽～? Ōkami Chronicles: Tiny Sun-RRB- was indeed a sequel to Ōkami for the Nintendo DS, to be released by Capcom in Japan in 2010. The game takes place three months after the end of Ōkami, with the player in control of Chibiterasu, another wolf like Amaterasu, and will feature the same style of gameplay, including the Celestial Brush using the DS's touchscreen controls. -LSB-edit-RSB- Reception -LSB-edit-RSB- Reviews Ōkami has received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics with an average score of 93 percent on Game Rankings, making it the eighth highest overall game of 2006 and second for the PS2, behind Konami's Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence. GameSpot gave it a 9 out of 10 and selected it as an Editor's Choice, citing that its ``visual design instantly stands out, but it turns out to be just one of many inspired aspects of this impressive action adventure game.'' IGN gave the game a 9.1 out of 10, as being ``beautiful, charismatic, engaging and one of the most original games you'll play anytime soon.'' Electronic Gaming Monthly's three reviewers gave it a 9, 9.5, and 9 out of ten, one saying: ``I'll be surprised if you can find a better game on any system this fall.'' Newtype USA named Ōkami its Game of the Month for October 2006, heralded the pacing as ``nearly flawless'' and proclaimed ``Ōkami is that rarest of beasts: a game without any obvious flaws. Clover's creativity and attention to detail are on full display here. Shame on any gamer who passes up this divine adventure.'' Eurogamer.net scored the game 10/10 saying ``Right from the start it conjures an atmosphere of being something special, but to keep that level of quality up consistently over 60 hours ensures that this will be a game that will be talked about for years to come''. In 2007, Ōkami was named eighteenth best PlayStation 2 game of all time in IGN's feature reflecting on the PlayStation 2's long lifespan. Famitsu gave the game a near perfect score of 39 out of 40, the 15th game to date to receive this score from the publication. -LSB-citation needed-RSB- However, the game was noted to have some flaws. Many reviews commented on the lack of difficulty within the game. Reviewers have also noted some difficulty in getting the game to recognize the correct Celestial Brush patterns, as well as excessive amounts of dialog, particularly at the introduction, which was also hampered by the computer-generated voices used in lieu of voice acting. The Wii version of Ōkami has received generally similar praise to the PlayStation 2 version, with GameSpot stating that the support for widescreen and the Wii controls ``make it even more relevant today than it was in 2006''. The use of the Wii Remote for the Celestial Brush was well received; in GameSpot's review, they noted that the Wii functionality with the Brush ``improves the pace of the game''. However, other aspects to the controls were found to be weaker, particularly in combat. In their review, Nintendo Power recommended the PlayStation 2 version of the game over the Wii, stating that ``Though you can overcome the drawing and attacking issues with practice -LRB-and by sticking to whip-style weapons-RRB-, it's a hurdle you shouldn't have to leap.'' It was a nominee for multiple awards from IGN in its 2008 video game awards, including Best Artistic Design and Best Use of the Wii-Mote. -LSB-edit-RSB- Awards Ōkami's initial showing at the 2005 E3 Convention garnered severals awards and recognition, including 1UP's Best PS2 Game, 2nd Best Game of Show, and 3rd Best Action Game; IGN's Best PS2 Game of Show, and runner-up for Best of Show and Most Innovative Design; and X-Play's Most Original Game. GameSpy recognized it as the 5th best game showing for the convention. Upon release, Ōkami appeared as the Game of the Month for IGN, Electronic Gaming Monthly, and Game Informer. IGN, Edge Magazine and Game Revolution rated it as the best overall game of 2006, while Game Trailers and Official PlayStation Magazine, named it best PS2 game for 2006. IGN further awarded the game the Best Overall and PS2 Adventure Game, the Best Overall and PS2 Artistic Design, the Overall and PS2 Most Innovative Design, and the Best Overall Story. GameSpot awarded the game for the Best Artistic Graphics for 2006. IGN named Ōkami the ninetieth top game of all time in a December 2007 Top 100 list. Ōkami has also won awards from outside the mainstream gaming press. The game earned the Best Character Design and only one of three Innovation Awards at the 2007 Game Developers Choice Awards. Ōkami won the Grand Prize in the Entertainment Division of the 2006 Japan Media Arts Festival. It was also awarded the best Animation in a Game Engine, Art Direction in a Game Engine, Outstanding Original Adventure Game, and Game of the Year in the 2006 awards by the National Academy of Video Game Testers and Reviewers -LRB-NAVIGaTR-RRB-. Ōkami was given an ``Award for Excellence'' from the Japanese Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association -LRB-CESA-RRB- at the Japan Game Awards 2007 and was later given 2009 CESA Developers Conference -LRB-CEDEC-RRB- award for ``Visual Arts''. The game was awarded the Best Anthropomorphic Video Game in the 2006 Ursa Major awards. It also won the 2007 BAFTA awards for Artistic Achievement and Original Score. -LSB-edit-RSB- Sales Ōkami sold 200,000 copies in North America in 2006, grossing approximately USD$8 million and ranking as the 100th best selling game of the year in the region. By March 2007, the total sales of the PlayStation 2 version were near 270,000. By comparison, Ōkami sold 66,000 copies in Japan for 2006. While it was initially thought that poor sales of Ōkami and God Hand -LRB-another Clover title released in the same time frame-RRB- were the cause of the closure of Clover Studio, it was later revealed that three key developers within Capcom and Clover Studios, Shinji Mikami -LRB-Resident Evil series-RRB-, Hideki Kamiya -LRB-Devil May Cry series-RRB-, and Inaba, had left the company, and the studio was dissolved, such that ``now all the resources should be used more effectively and more efficiently since they are centralized.'' Inaba, Mikami, and Kamiya went on to form the video game development company ``Seeds Inc'', later merging with a company called ``ODD'' to become ``Platinum Games''. On 30 July 2008, Capcom revealed that the Wii version of Ōkami had sold approximately 280,000 copies in North America and Europe since its release date. The Wii version debuted in Japan with a modest 24,000 copies sold in its first week in the region. Total sales for the game remained under 600,000 total units by March 2009, and was named the ``least commercially successful winner of a game of the year award'' in the 2010 version of the Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition. -LSB-edit-RSB- Legacy Ben Mattes, producer for the 2008 Prince of Persia video game, cites Ōkami as well as Ico and Shadow of the Colossus as influences on the gameplay and artwork for the game. Capcom's Street Fighter IV is also stated to have models influenced by Ōkami with hand-drawn images and brushstroke-like effects. An upcoming video game, Epic Mickey, uses similar drawing aspects as Ōkami allowing the player to draw and modify parts of levels to proceed. The final boss, Yami, appears as a boss character in the crossover fighting game, Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All Stars. Ōkami was originally planned to be rendered in a more photorealistic 3D style. -LSB-edit-RSB- Characters The player controls Ōkami Amaterasu, the goddess of the sun, in the form of a white wolf.

The Pacific season was expected to be hindered by the decades-long cycle that began in 1995, which generally increased wind shear across the basin. NOAA predicted a below-normal level of activity in the Eastern Pacific, with 12--16�named storms, of which 6--8 were expected to become hurricanes, and 1--3 expected to become major hurricanes. The Central Pacific basin was also expected to be below average, with only two to three tropical cyclones expected to form or cross into the area. They expected that neither El Niño nor La Niña would affect conditions significantly. -LSB-edit-RSB- Storms -LSB-edit-RSB- May and June On May�15, the hurricane season began in the Eastern Pacific basin, which is the area of the northern Pacific Ocean east of 140ºW. Twelve days later, an area of disturbed weather developed into the first tropical depression of the season, about 190�mi -LRB-310�km-RRB- south of Acapulco, Mexico. It quickly intensified into a tropical storm, and upon doing so was named Aletta. The storm drifted northeastward toward the coast, bringing light rainfall before turning southward. Wind shear weakened the storm, and on May�31 Aletta dissipated about 200�mi -LRB-320�km-RRB- west-northwest of where it formed. On June�1, the season began in the Central Pacific basin, which is the region between 140ºW and the International Dateline; however, no storms occurred in the basin until July. In the Eastern Pacific, Tropical Depression Two-E formed on June�3 about 145�mi -LRB-245�km-RRB- southwest of Zihuatanejo, Mexico. It tracked eastward and brought heavy rainfall to the coastline, with a report of about 11�inches -LRB-280�mm-RRB- in Acapulco. Land interaction weakened the depression, and it dissipated on June�5. No tropical storms developed in June in the basin, which was unusual compared to the average of two storms forming during the month. Since 1966, there have been only three other seasons in which a tropical storm did not form in June, these being 1969, 2004, and 2007. -LSB-edit-RSB- July After about a month of no storms, the basin became active in July. The first storm of the month was Hurricane Bud, which developed early on July�11 about 805�mi -LRB-1300�km-RRB- south of Cabo San Lucas. Moving west-northwestward, it encountered conditions for quick strengthening, and within 24�hours of forming it attained hurricane status. Bud continued strengthening, reaching major hurricane status, or Category�3 status on the Saffir-Simpson scale, and peak winds of 125�mph -LRB-205�km/h-RRB- on July�13. Thereafter, cooler waters and stable air caused the hurricane to quickly weaken. On July�14, Bud weakened to tropical storm status, and two days later it degenerated into a remnant low pressure area. The remnants of Bud dissipated on July�17 about 750�mi -LRB-1210�km-RRB- east-southeast of Hawaii. One day after Bud formed, a tropical disturbance organized into a tropical depression about 290�mi -LRB-465�km-RRB- off the coast of Mexico, which would later become Hurricane Carlotta. A large cyclone, its outer rainbands brushed the coastline of Mexico, as it steadily intensified to reach tropical storm and later hurricane status within 30�hours of forming. Outflow from Hurricane Bud prevented Carlotta from strengthening much further, though for a period of about 60�hours it fluctuated between strong tropical storm status and minimal hurricane status. Cooler waters weakened the storm, and on July�16 Carlotta degenerated into a remnant low. Its low-level circulation persisted for three days before dissipating. As the previous two storms were dissipating, a new tropical depression formed off the southwest coast of Mexico on July�16, which would later become Hurricane Daniel. It moved westward, gradually intensifying under favorable conditions. On July�22, it attained peak winds of 150�mph -LRB-240�km/h-RRB-, a Category�4 on the Saffir-Simpson scale and making Daniel the strongest hurricane during the season in the NHC area of responsibility. Maintaining Category�4 status for about three days, the hurricane subsequently weakened quickly due to cooler waters. Daniel was briefly forecast to move through the Hawaiian Islands as a tropical storm; however, the storm continued to weaken, degenerating into a remnant low on July�27 about 800�mi -LRB-1290�km-RRB- east-southeast of Hilo, Hawaii. Its remnants brought moderate rainfall to the region, though no damage or deaths were reported. Another tropical depression formed off the coast of Mexico on July�21. It tracked northward toward the coast, strengthening into Tropical Storm Emilia and attaining peak winds of 65�mph -LRB-105�km/h-RRB-. It briefly developed an eye, though weakened due to increased wind shear as it turned away from the coast. Emilia later turned to the north, restrengthening to its peak intensity before weakening and paralleling the coastline of the Baja California peninsula. After dropping moderate rainfall along the peninsula, it weakened further as it turned out to sea, and on July�27 degenerated into a remnant low. The final storm of the month formed on July�31 from a tropical wave, well to the southwest of Mexico. It maintained a steady westward track throughout its duration, and quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Fabio. On August�1 it attained peak winds of 50�mph -LRB-85�km/h-RRB-, but subsequently began gradually weakening due to wind shear. Fabio degenerated into a remnant low on August�4, and a few days later brought locally heavy rainfall to Hawaii. -LSB-edit-RSB- August Within the basin, more tropical cyclones developed in August than in any other month. The first storm of the month was Tropical Storm Gilma, which in terms of winds was tied with Rosa for the weakest named storm of the season. Gilma developed on August�1 off the southwest coast of Mexico, attaining peak winds of 40�mph -LRB-65�km/h-RRB-. The storm was disorganized due to persistent wind shear, which prevented further strengthening. On August�5 the cyclone dissipated without ever having affected land. After a period of inactivity lasting a week and a half, a tropical depression formed southwest of Mexico on August�15. It tracked generally west-northwestward for its entire duration, eventually becoming Hurricane Hector. On August�18, it attained peak winds of 110�mph -LRB-175�km/h-RRB-, before gradually weakening due to cooler waters. Weakening to a tropical storm on August�20, it later turned sharply to the west, degenerating into a remnant low on August�23 and dissipating the next day without affecting land. The strongest hurricane of the season was Hurricane Ioke, which formed on August�20 far to the south of Hawaii. It was the first central Pacific named storm since Hurricane Huko in 2002. Encountering warm waters and little wind shear, and maintaining well-defined outflow, Ioke intensified from a tropical depression to Category�4 status on the Saffir-Simpson scale within 48�hours. Late on August�22 it rapidly weakened to Category�2 status before crossing over Johnston Atoll, where 12�people rode out the storm in a hurricane-proof bunker. Two days later, favorable conditions again allowed for rapid strengthening, and Ioke attained Category�5 status on August�25 before crossing the International Date Line. As it continued westward its intensity fluctuated, and on August�31 it passed near Wake Island with winds of 155�mph -LRB-249�km/h-RRB-. Ioke gradually weakened as it turned northwestward and northward, and by September�6 transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The remnants of Ioke accelerated northeastward and ultimately crossed into Alaska. On August�21 shortly after the previous storm formed, Hurricane Ileana developed off the southwest coast of Mexico. It generally paralleled the coastline throughout its duration, ultimately reaching peak winds of 120�mph -LRB-195�km/h-RRB- before weakening. Around the time of peak intensity, the hurricane passed near Socorro Island, where it produced hurricane-force wind gusts. On August�27, Ileana degenerated into a remnant low, and two days later dissipated well offshore. The next tropical depression, which would eventually become Hurricane John, formed on August�28 about 250�mi -LRB-400�km-RRB- off the coast of Mexico. With favorable environmental conditions, the system quickly organized, becoming a hurricane within 36�hours of forming. Hurricane John continued rapid intensification and reached peak winds of 135�mph -LRB-215�km/h-RRB- on August�30 while just off the Mexican coast. Land interaction weakened the hurricane, and still tracking northwestward it struck the eastern portion of the Baja California peninsula on September�2 as a Category�2 hurricane. John dissipated on September�4, though its remnants brought rainfall to the southwest United States. The last storm to develop in August was Hurricane Kristy, which formed on August�30 about 935�mi -LRB-1505�km-RRB- west-northwest of Hurricane John. It initially tracked northwestward, reaching peak winds of 80�mph -LRB-130�km/h-RRB- within 36�hours of forming. Outflow from Hurricane John caused Kristy to weaken, and at the same time, the storm's motion became nearly stationary as steering currents collapsed. On September�2 it turned to a southeast drift, and degenerated into a tropical depression around the same time. Kristy later turned to the west, oscillating between tropical depression and tropical storm status until dissipating on September�9. -LSB-edit-RSB- September Hurricane Lane developed from a tropical wave on September�13 to the south of Mexico. It moved northwestward parallel to the coast of Mexico, and steadily intensified in a favorable environment. After turning to the northeast Lane attained peak winds of 125�mph -LRB-205�km/h-RRB-, and made landfall in the Mexican state of Sinaloa at peak strength. It rapidly weakened and dissipated on September�17, and later brought precipitation to southern Texas. An area of disturbed weather associated with the Intertropical Convergence Zone spawned a tropical depression on September�16 off the coast of Mexico. Despite being disorganized, it quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Miriam. The storm was sheared throughout its duration, and after encountering cooler waters Miriam dissipated on September�18 near the Baja California peninsula. On September�18, an area of disturbed weather in the central Pacific became sufficiently organized and was designated Tropical Depression Two-C. Vertical wind shear caused the depression to weaken into a remnant low on September�20, it never having attained tropical storm status. The depression was initially thought to be a regeneration of earlier Hurricane Kristy. On September�26, another area of disturbed weather in the Central Pacific near the International Date Line became organized and was designated Tropical Depression Three-C. However, wind shear and the presence of dry air to the west inhibited further development, and the system dissipated 12�hours later; at around the same time, the system crossed into the Western Pacific. -LSB-edit-RSB- October The first cyclone to develop in the month of October was Tropical Storm Norman, which formed well off the coast of Mexico on October�9. It quickly reached peak winds of 50�mph -LRB-85�km/h-RRB-, though almost as quickly the cyclone degenerated into a remnant low due to wind shear. Its remnants turned to the east, and on October�15 regenerated into a tropical cyclone just off the coast of Mexico after merging with another disturbance. Norman quickly dissipated as unfavorable conditions returned, although it brought heavy rainfall to the Mexican coastline. Tropical Storm Olivia formed on October�9 about 700�mi -LRB-1120�km-RRB- west of Norman. Tracking northeastward and attaining tropical storm status, it failed to strengthen significantly due to wind shear. Olivia weakened to tropical depression status on October�11, and turning to the east-southeast degenerated into a remnant low two days later. Its remnants were later absorbed by a larger disturbance that included the remnants of Norman. The final cyclone to develop within the CPHC area of responsibility was Tropical Depression Four-C, which formed on October�13 to the southwest of Hawaii. Within 24�hours of forming, it degenerated into a remnant disturbance due to unfavorable wind shear. Moisture from the depression contributed to heavy rainfall in Hawaii. The strongest hurricane during the month was Hurricane Paul. Forming on October�21, it did not strengthen much initially due to the presence of wind shear. However, a decrease in shear allowed Paul to strengthen rapidly, and in a 24-hour period it developed from a moderate tropical storm to a 105�mph -LRB-170�km/h-RRB- hurricane, its peak intensity. By that time, it had turned northeastward and entered an unfavorable environment, which caused Paul to steadily weaken to tropical storm status. After passing south of the Baja California peninsula it deteriorated to tropical depression status and moved ashore in northwestern Sinaloa. On October�26 shortly after Paul dissipated, another tropical depression formed off the southwest coast of Mexico. Moving southwestward, it encountered unfavorable wind shear, which prevented strengthening. On October�28 it degenerated into a remnant low, and the next day dissipated without affecting land. -LSB-edit-RSB- Unclassified storm An extratropical storm persisted in the extreme northern central Pacific Ocean in late October. It drifted over unusually warm waters up to 3.6°F -LRB-2°C-RRB- above normal, and gradually developed convection near the center. By November�2, QuikSCAT satellite suggested the system attained winds of up to 60�mph -LRB-95�km/h-RRB- about 900�mi -LRB-1450�km-RRB- west of Oregon. The system also developed an eye and an eyewall. The cyclone tracked northeastward as it gradually weakened, and dissipated on November�4. NASA considered the cyclone to be a subtropical storm. However, as it formed outside of the territory of any monitoring organization, it was not named. Operationally, the United States Navy treated the system as a tropical disturbance, numbered 91C. -LSB-edit-RSB- November Tropical activity within the basin in November�2006 was the most active on record, based on the Accumulated Cyclone Energy -LRB-ACE-RRB- Index. Three tropical cyclones formed, of which two became tropical storms; only one other season on record, 1966, produced two tropical storms in the month of November. The first storm of the month was Tropical Storm Rosa, which formed on November�8 as a tropical depression off the southwest coast of Mexico. Immediate development was hampered by wind shear, although an increase in thunderstorms on November�9 brought the depression to tropical storm status. Continued shear prevented intensification, and Rosa dissipated on November�10. Rosa was the first Eastern Pacific tropical storm in November since another storm named Rosa in the 2000 season. On November�11, another tropical depression formed off the coast of Mexico, about 450�mi -LRB-720�km-RRB- west-southwest of where Rosa dissipated the previous day. Similar to Rosa, it developed within an environment with unfavorable wind shear, but failed to intensify beyond tropical depression status. About 18�hours after it formed the depression degenerated into a trough. The final storm of the season was Hurricane Sergio, which was both the strongest and longest-lived November Pacific hurricane on record. It formed on November�13 about 460�mi -LRB-740�km-RRB- south of Manzanillo, Colima, and steadily intensified while tracking southeastward. It reached peak winds of 110�mph -LRB-175�km/h-RRB- on November�15, and subsequently began to weaken due to increased wind shear as it turned to the north. Sergio later turned to the west, remaining well off the coast of Mexico, and dissipated on November�20 about 320�mi -LRB-515�km-RRB- west-northwest of it originally formed. The storm brought light rainfall to the Mexican coastline, though no major effects were reported. -LSB-edit-RSB- Impact During the season, tropical cyclones collectively caused 14�fatalities and $355�million in damage -LRB-2006�USD-RRB-. -LSB-nb 1-RSB- With its long coastline, the country of Mexico was affected by ten of the cyclones during the season, including four that made landfall. Of the six storms that affected Mexico but did not strike the country, the first was Tropical Storm Aletta, the first storm of the season, which brought light rainfall and caused minor damage. The next tropical depression of the season produced heavy rainfall in the Acapulco area while remaining offshore; mudslides and flooding were reported, and 72�people were forced to leave their homes. In July, Hurricane Carlotta brushed the coastline with light rainfall. When Tropical Storm Emilia passed just off the coast of Baja California, it brought moderate precipitation which caused minor flooding and damage around Cabo San Lucas. Heavy surf from Hurricane Ileana killed a man near Cabo San Lucas. The last storm of the season, Hurricane Sergio, produced light rainfall along the coast while remaining well offshore. Mexico was struck by four tropical cyclones in 2006, all along the Pacific coast. The first was Hurricane John, which made landfall near the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula on September�1. Earlier, it produced flooding and high surf near Acapulco while paralleling the coastline, and later the hurricane damaged or destroyed at least 450�homes in the Baja California peninsula. Hurricane John was the wettest tropical cyclone of the year in Mexico, dropping 17.7�in -LRB-449�mm-RRB- of rainfall. Five people were killed, and damage in Mexico amounted to $663�million -LRB-2006�MXN, $60.8�million 2006�USD-RRB-. Hurricane Lane moved ashore in the state of Sinaloa as a Category�3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale, which was the strongest landfall during the season. Paralleling the coastline a short distance offshore, the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall, causing flooding and mudslides which resulted in four fatalities. Hurricane Lane affected 4,320�houses, and a total of 19,200�mi -LRB-30,000�km-RRB- of roads and highways were damaged to some degree. Monetary damage amounted to about $2.2�billion -LRB-2006�MXN, $203�million 2006�USD-RRB- in damage in the country. In early October, former Tropical Storm Norman passed near or over southwestern Mexico, destroying 20�houses and leaving 20�villages without power. Later, former Hurricane Paul caused four deaths, two of which from rough seas and two from drowning in a flooded river. The storm damaged 5,000�houses, and monetary damage totaled more than $35�million -LRB-2006�MXN, $3.2�million 2006�USD-RRB-. Three of the cyclones that affected Mexico also impacted the southwestern United States. Moisture from Tropical Storm Emilia produced thunderstorms in Arizona which caused flooding, and in southern California its rainfall assisted firefighters in combating a wildfire. The remnants of Hurricane John produced moisture across much of the southwestern United States, causing mudslides in California, light rainfall in Arizona, overflowed rivers in New Mexico, and up to 8�in -LRB-200�mm-RRB- of rainfall in Texas. In western Texas, the precipitation was beneficial in some areas but damaging in others, causing flooded roads and washouts. The remnants of Hurricane Lane also produced rainfall in Texas. Four tropical cyclones affected the U.S. state of Hawaii, all of which were the remnants of former tropical cyclones. Moisture from Hurricane Bud produced light rainfall in east-facing slopes of the island chain. Former Hurricane Daniel produced up to 5�in -LRB-125�mm-RRB- of rainfall in the state, though no significant impact was reported. The remnants of Tropical Storm Fabio contributed to heavy rainfall, peaking at 15.08�in -LRB-383�mm-RRB- on Mount Waiʻaleʻale on the island of Kauai; the rainfall caused river and roadway flooding, but little damage. Moisture from Tropical Depression Four-C in October contributed to heavy rainfall on the island of Hawaii. The strongest hurricane of the season was Hurricane Ioke, which reached Category 5 status in the central Pacific Ocean. It first affected the uninhabited Johnston Atoll, although when Ioke struck there was a crew of 12�people taking shelter on the island. Hurricane force winds affected the landmass, powerful enough to knock down trees. In the western Pacific Ocean after being re-classified as a typhoon, Ioke passed near Wake Island, forcing the first full-scale evacuation of the island since a typhoon in 1967. The combination of strong winds and a powerful storm surge damaged 70% of the buildings on the island, many with moderate roof damage. Destruction on the island was estimated at $88�million -LRB-2006�USD-RRB-. Later, the storm passed near the Japanese island of Minami Torishima, which was also fully evacuated; facilities on the island were damaged, although it was repaired and fully operational within three weeks after the storm. The remnants of Ioke later brought hurricane force wind gusts to southwestern Alaska. -LSB-edit-RSB- Season effects This is a table of the storms in 2006 and their landfall-LRB-s-RRB-, if any; the table does not include storms that did not make landfall, which is defined as the center of the storm moving over a landmass. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect -LRB-an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident-RRB-, but are still storm-related. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical or a wave or low. -LSB-edit-RSB- Storm names The following names were used for named storms that formed in the northeast Pacific in 2006. This is the same list that was used in the 2000 season. There were no names retired from the northeast Pacific list. Therefore, the same list will be reused in the 2012 season. Storms that formed in the central Pacific are given names from a sequential list; in 2006, the name Ioke was used from this list, the first time a name from the Central Pacific list had been used since the 2002 season. -LSB-edit-RSB- Retirement The name Ioke was retired from the north-central Pacific list by the WMO in the spring of 2007 and replaced with Iopa. During the 61st Interdepartmental Hurricane Conference, the Hawaii State Civil Defense requested the retirement of the name Daniel, citing that the storm had become memorable due to threat or damage. However, the request was denied, as the name remains on the tropical cyclone naming list. Three tropical cyclones formed, of which two became tropical storms; only one other season on record, 1966, produced two tropical storms in the month of November.
